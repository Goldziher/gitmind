describe_commit_response = """The commit reflects systematic updates and refinements across various files in the codebase, involving multiple types of
changes without any net additions or deletions in terms of functionality. The changes span 14 files and total 14 lines
of modifications. Below is a detailed breakdown by file and the nature of changes:

### File-by-File Breakdown

1. **`.env`**
    - **Insertions:** 1
    - Removed sensitive information, specifically a hardcoded OpenAI API key.

2. **`.gitignore`**
    - **Insertions:** 1
    - Adjusted ignored files, specifically by removing `.env` from the list.

3. **`e2e/__init__.py`**
    - No changes made.

4. **`e2e/test_describe_commit.py`**
    - **Deletions:** 42
    - The entire test file was removed. This file contained an asynchronous test function for describing commits using
      OpenAIâ€™s API.

5. **`pdm.lock`**
    - **Insertions:** 12
    - **Deletions:** 1
    - Updated dependencies and the content hash, reflecting library version changes and removal of the `python-dotenv`
      package.

6. **`pyproject.toml`**
    - **Insertions:** 6
    - Adjusted dependencies and configurations, likely aligning them with changes in other parts of the project.

7. **`src/commit.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 2
    - **Deletions:** 2
    - Modified import paths and the internals of `extract_commit_data` method for better consistency and possibly to
      rectify errors.

8. **`src/llm/base.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 1
    - **Deletions:** 1
    - Minor method signature change from synchronous initialization to asynchronous (`init` method).

9. **`src/llm/openai_client.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 37
    - **Deletions:** 18
    - Significant revisions to support more robust interaction with OpenAI API, including updated response handling and
      improved error management.

10. **`src/llm/result.md`**
    - **Insertions:** 86
    - Added detailed documentation or result markdown about the changes for
      commit `d63b4db42993cd0e5262f79a62c022d09c051eef`.

11. **`src/prompts.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 3
    - **Deletions:** 3
    - Adjusted import paths and possibly refined methods for consistency and performance.

12. **`src/repository.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 6
    - **Deletions:** 6
    - Updated method signatures and internal variables for correctness and perhaps simplifying usage patterns.

13. **`src/types.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 3
    - **Deletions:** 1
    - Minor adjustments to types to ensure alignment with the broader refactor.

14. **`src/utils/serialization.py`**
    - **Insertions:** 1
    - **Deletions:** 1
    - Adjusted serialization utility to use sorted order for encoding.

### Key Objectives

- **Refactoring & Cleanup**:
    - Removed hardcoded credentials and sensitive information.
    - Removed outdated or unused test functions and dependencies.
    - Simplified and corrected import paths and method signatures.

- **Improved Code Consistency**:
    - Ensured consistency in method signatures and variable naming conventions.
    - Applied changes uniformly across related modules, e.g., LLM-related classes and methods.

- **Library and Dependency Updates**:
    - Updated dependencies in `pdm.lock` and `pyproject.toml`, including removing the `python-dotenv` library,
      reflecting a move away from using `.env` files for configuration.

### Summary

This commit is a comprehensive maintenance and refactor, enhancing code quality, security, and consistency. Major
aspects include removal of sensitive hardcoding, dependency cleanup, and rigorous alignment of import paths and method
conventions across the codebase."""
