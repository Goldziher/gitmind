//! Canary locking the `publish.yaml` ordering invariants so a later refactor cannot
//! silently let a registry publish run before the GitHub release is finalized, or let a
//! partial draft masquerade as a complete release. Post-mortem of the v0.22.1 release
//! window: the plugin/npm `latest` pointer and the crates.io push must only advance once
//! every platform asset exists and the release has been promoted — otherwise a downstream
//! clean install resolves a version whose binaries are not yet downloadable.
//!
//! These are structural assertions over the workflow text (no YAML dependency): they slice
//! a job's block and check the `needs` / `if` gating and the required-asset set within it.
