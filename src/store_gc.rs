//! Cache garbage-collection + cleanup for the `.basemind/` directory.
//!
//! Two responsibilities:
//!
//! 1. **Mark-and-sweep GC of the shared blob store** ([`run_gc`]). Blobs under
//!    `.basemind/blobs/` are content-addressed and shared across every view; a blob is
//!    *live* iff some view's `index.msgpack` still references its content hash. Re-scans
//!    and branch switches leave behind blobs no view points at anymore — this reclaims them.
//! 2. **Whole-component cleanup** ([`clear_component`]) and **introspection**
//!    ([`cache_stats`]) for the CLI / MCP admin surface (wired up by separate workstreams).
//!
//! ## Why a single content hash addresses both blob suffixes
//!
//! Each [`crate::store::FileEntry`] carries exactly one `hash_hex` — the content hash of the
//! source file. The scanner writes up to two blobs for that file, both keyed by the *same*
//! hash with different suffixes: `<hash>.fm.msgpack` (the combined L1 + L2 filemap) and
//! (documents build) `<hash>.doc.msgpack`. So the set of live blob stems is exactly the set
//! of `hash_hex` values across all entries of all views — there is no separate `fm_hash` /
//! `doc_hash` to union.
