//! Precomputed git-history index — a separate, repo-level Fjall store that turns the
//! history MCP tools (`commits_touching`, `recent_changes`, `find_commits_by_path`,
//! `hot_files`, and the commit-walk of `symbol_history`) from live history walks into
//! posting-list lookups.
//!
//! ## Why a separate DB
//!
//! Lives at `.basemind/git-history.fjall/` — a sibling of `views/` and `git-cache/`, NOT inside a
//! per-view `index.fjall`. Git history is repo-global (identical across the working/staged/rev
//! views) and immortal/append-only as HEAD advances, so it carries its own [`GIT_HISTORY_SCHEMA`]
//! and survives an `INDEX_SCHEMA_VER` bump — a code-map schema change must never throw away the
//! expensive 200k-commit walk.
//!
//! ## Single-writer, and who holds the lock
//!
//! Fjall takes an exclusive per-directory process lock — even a read-only open takes it — so exactly
//! ONE process may hold this DB. Which process that is depends on the deployment:
//!
//! * **Standalone** (no daemon: `scan` / `rescan`, a `serve` that is itself the writer, a one-shot
//!   CLI query): that process opens the DB locally ([`Backend::Local`]) and, if it is a writer,
//!   builds it in-process.
//! * **Daemon** (a `comms` build, where the daemon is the machine's sole fjall writer): the DAEMON
//!   holds the DB and builds it, and EVERY front-end — a `daemon_writer` serve, and equally the
//!   one-shot CLI — holds a [`Backend::Remote`] proxy that forwards each history query over the
//!   socket. A front-end must not try to open the DB: it cannot win a lock the daemon holds, so it
//!   would only stall on the retry ladder and then live-walk forever. And building it in a front-end
//!   would be doubly wrong — it would steal the lock the daemon (and every peer session) needs, and
//!   it would run a multi-GB, minutes-long walk inside the process an agent is actively querying.
//!
//! A process that can reach neither keeps `git_history: None` and falls back to the live walk. The
//! index is a pure accelerator — tools use it only when `last_indexed_head == HEAD` and otherwise
//! live-walk (reporting `partial: true`), so it can never serve stale or incorrect results.
//!
//! ## Partitions
//!
//! | partition | key | value |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `gh_meta` | fixed byte-strings | schema_ver, last_indexed_head, counters, fingerprint |
//! | `gh_commit_by_ord` | `ord:u32_be` | msgpack [`CommitMeta`] (interned file list) |
//! | `gh_ord_by_sha` | `sha:20 raw` | `ord:u32_be` |
//! | `gh_path_id_by_path` | `u16:len ‖ rel` | `path_id:u32_be` |
//! | `gh_path_by_id` | `path_id:u32_be` | raw `rel` bytes |
//! | `gh_path_to_ords` | `path_id:u32_be` | delta-varint ordinal posting list |
//! | `gh_commit_text_by_ord` | `ord:u32_be` | full commit message body (FTS) |
//! | `gh_term_to_ords` | `field:u8 ‖ term` | delta-varint ordinal posting list (FTS) |
