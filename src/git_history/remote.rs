//! The serve-side half of the forwarded git-history path: a [`GitHistoryIndex`] backed by the
//! daemon instead of by a local fjall database.
//!
//! ## Why serve cannot just open the index
//!
//! Fjall takes an exclusive advisory lock on the database directory — even a read-only open takes
//! it. `git-history.fjall/` is therefore a single-holder resource. Under the daemon-as-sole-writer
//! model the daemon must hold it (it is the process that builds it, and N concurrent serve sessions
//! cannot each hold a lock only one of them can win). So a `daemon_writer` serve holds NO handle and
//! forwards its history reads here, exactly as it already forwards scans
//! ([`CommsRequest::Rescan`](crate::comms::protocol::CommsRequest::Rescan)) and precise
//! resolved-reference reads ([`ResolvedRefs`](crate::comms::protocol::CommsRequest::ResolvedRefs)).
//!
//! ## Cost
//!
//! One UDS round trip per history tool call (plus one for the freshness check), against ~37 µs for a
//! local indexed lookup and ~1.6–2.5 ms for the live walk it replaces. The ops are coarse — a whole
//! result page per round trip — so the forwarded path stays O(1) IPC per tool call.
//!
//! ## Blocking bridge
//!
//! The MCP history tools call the index from synchronous code inside their async bodies, so the
//! forwarded call has to block. It does so via [`tokio::task::block_in_place`], which requires the
//! multi-threaded runtime `basemind serve` runs on. Off a multi-thread runtime (a `current_thread`
//! test, a rayon worker) the call degrades to `None` rather than panicking, and the caller live-walks.
