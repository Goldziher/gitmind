//! Fjall-backed inverted index over the msgpack content-addressed blob store.
//!
//! The blob store (`.basemind/blobs/<hash>.fm.msgpack`) stays canonical — it holds the per-
//! file extracted maps (L1 outline + L2 calls) in their full shape. This module adds a
//! *secondary* index on top:
//! six Fjall keyspaces that let MCP tools answer "who calls `foo`?" or "what imports
//! `requests`?" via prefix range scans instead of linear sweeps over the in-RAM map.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! `.basemind/views/<view>/index.fjall/` — Fjall manages its own directory shape.
//!
//! ## Schema versioning
//!
//! The `meta` keyspace carries a `schema_ver` row. Mismatch on open drops the whole
//! `index.fjall/` directory and the caller is expected to repopulate it from the existing
//! msgpack blobs. This is fast (no parsing — just decode each L1, push to secondary
//! indexes) and keeps the on-disk format free to evolve.
