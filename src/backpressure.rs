//! Best-effort memory backpressure for the allocation-heavy stages of a scan.
//!
//! A [`FootprintGate`] throttles admission to the two stages that dominate a scan's peak
//! memory — document extraction and code-chunk embedding — against the `[resources]`
//! `max_footprint_mb` ceiling. When the process is over the ceiling, the calling worker
//! parks in a bounded backoff loop so in-flight work can complete and release memory before
//! more is admitted.
//!
//! It is deliberately *best-effort* and never fails a scan:
//! - `max_footprint_mb = "off"`, or an auto ceiling on a platform that reports no memory
//!   limit, makes the gate a no-op ([`AdmitOutcome::Disabled`]).
//! - a sampler that cannot read the footprint (an unsupported platform, or a failed syscall)
//!   admits immediately ([`AdmitOutcome::Unavailable`]).
//! - after `max_wait` over the ceiling the gate admits anyway ([`AdmitOutcome::WaitedOut`]),
//!   trading a memory overshoot for guaranteed forward progress — the goal is to shave the
//!   peak, not to enforce an invariant the allocator won't.
//!
//! The gate holds no global state: the scanner constructs one per admit point from the
//! injected [`Config`](crate::config), sampling [`crate::sysres::phys_footprint`]. Tests
//! inject a stub sampler to drive the over-then-under transition deterministically without
//! touching real memory.
