//! Cross-file resolution stitch (feature `code-intel-js` or `code-intel-stack`).
//!
//! The per-file resolve pass caches each file's *intra*-file resolved edges plus its import and
//! export lists (see [`crate::intel::model::FileResolvedRefs`]). This module runs once at the end
//! of that pass and computes the piece those per-file facts deliberately omit: the **cross-file**
//! edge that links an importer's local binding to the exported definition it actually refers to.
//!
//! The join is:
//!
//! 1. For each importer file, pick the [`SpecifierResolver`] for its language and resolve every
//!    runtime (`is_type == false`) [`ImportEdge`]'s module `specifier` to a repo-relative target
//!    file (JS/TS: Node/tsconfig resolution via oxc; Python/Java: package/source-root path
//!    arithmetic). An importer whose language has no compiled-in resolver is skipped.
//! 2. Require that target to be an indexed file.
//! 3. In the target file's export list, find the [`ExportEdge`] whose `name` matches the import's
//!    `imported` name (or `"default"` for default / namespace imports, whose `imported` is `None`).
//! 4. Emit a cross-file edge — **def** = `(target, export.name_start)`, **use** =
//!    `(importer, import.local_start)` — into `refs_by_def` + `refs_by_path`.
//!
//! Best-effort: any resolver miss or unindexed target is logged at debug and skipped; a commit
//! failure warns but never aborts the scan. Idempotency across re-scans is documented on
//! [`crate::index::writer::IndexWriter::upsert_cross_file_edge`].
