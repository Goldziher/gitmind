//! Rules-block content generation for `basemind init`.
//!
//! The onboarding flow injects a "prefer basemind over grep/read/git" rule into the host repo's
//! agent-instructions file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / an ai-rulez rule). This module is the pure
//! content layer: given the selected [`Capability`] set and which optional sections are on, it
//! renders the markdown body. It performs no I/O — [`super::init`] owns file placement and the
//! idempotent delimited-block splice.
//!
//! The prose is condensed from `.ai-rulez/rules/agent-comms.md`: basemind first, shell/grep/git
//! is the fallback. Rows are emitted only for capabilities the user selected, so the advice never
//! advertises a tool the build/config can't serve.
