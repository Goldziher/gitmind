//! `basemind init` — the re-runnable onboarding flow.
//!
//! Two side effects, each idempotent and safe to re-run:
//! 1. Write the commented `basemind.toml` scaffold at the repo root (kept, never clobbered, when
//!    one already exists).
//! 2. Inject a "prefer basemind over grep / read / git" rules block into the host repo's
//!    agent-instructions file — an idempotent delimited block in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md, or an
//!    ai-rulez rule file when `.ai-rulez/config.toml` owns governance.
//!
//! The index itself is never written into the repo: it lives in a machine-global cache under
//! `~/.local/share/basemind/` (override `BASEMIND_DATA_HOME`), keyed by workspace and served by a
//! background daemon, so there is nothing to gitignore.
//!
//! Capability selection (interactive in a TTY, flag-driven otherwise) narrows which routing rows
//! the rules block advertises. `main.rs` is a thin dispatcher into [`run`]; the block content
//! lives in [`super::init_rules`].
