//! The daemon's hot-index pool: the machinery that lets the broker be the machine's **sole fjall
//! writer**.
//!
//! Front-ends (`basemind serve`) open each workspace's store *read-only* and forward every write
//! (scan / rescan) to the daemon over the socket. The daemon runs those scans through this pool so
//! exactly one process ever holds a workspace's exclusive index lock — dissolving the multi-session
//! single-holder problem where a second read-write session would degrade to read-only.
//!
//! Each hot workspace is an [`WorkspaceEntry`] holding an open read-write [`Store`] behind its own
//! `Mutex`. The outer map lock is held only for lookup / insertion / LRU bookkeeping — never across
//! a scan — so scans of distinct workspaces run concurrently while concurrent scans of the *same*
//! workspace serialize on that workspace's store lock (one writer, no double-open). The pool is
//! bounded: opening a cold workspace past the cap evicts the least-recently-used entry.
