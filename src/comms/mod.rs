//! Agent-to-agent communication substrate: multi-dimension THREADS, a per-agent inbox, and the
//! singleton broker daemon that backs them.
//!
//! A thread is a conversation addressed by at least two of `subject` / `path` (globset) /
//! `members`. Discovery is scoped — a thread is never globally visible; there is no auto-join.
//! [`ids`] holds the validated identifier newtypes that double as composite-key segments in the
//! comms store; the rest of the module adds the transport traits, the second Fjall-backed
//! `CommsStore`, the broker, and the front-ends (Unix socket, in-process, future A2A HTTP).
