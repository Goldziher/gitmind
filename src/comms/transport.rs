//! Transport abstraction for the broker: front-ends accept links, links carry frames.
//!
//! Two implementations live alongside this module: [`UdsFrontend`](super::frontend_uds) over a
//! Unix domain socket (the production IPC path) and
//! [`InProcFrontend`](super::frontend_inproc) over tokio mpsc channels (for same-process
//! embedding and tests). Both decode the same [`CommsRequest`] and emit the same
//! [`CommsOut`], so the broker is transport-agnostic.
//!
//! ## Frame codec
//!
//! The Unix-socket link frames with [`tokio_util::codec::LengthDelimitedCodec`] (a `u32`
//! big-endian length prefix) and a msgpack body. The in-process link skips framing entirely
//! and moves owned values across channels.
