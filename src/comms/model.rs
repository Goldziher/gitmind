//! Persisted and wire data model for the comms broker.
//!
//! Two-tier message storage is the central design decision: every post writes a small
//! [`MessageMeta`] front-matter record (subject, sender, timestamps, body hash + length)
//! and a separate [`MessageBody`] blob. History and inbox lookups read ONLY the front-matter
//! — the body is fetched lazily via `get_body`. This keeps the hot "what's new?" path cheap
//! even when bodies are large.
//!
//! ## Thread model
//!
//! A [`Thread`] is a conversation addressed by AT LEAST TWO of three dimensions: a `subject`
//! (topic string), a `path` (a path or GLOB pattern matched with `globset`), and an explicit
//! `members` set of [`AgentId`]s. Discovery is scoped — a thread is never globally visible;
//! an agent sees it only when it is a member, when its cwd matches the thread's path-glob, or
//! when a subject substring filter matches. There is no auto-join: agents register, then
//! explicitly START a thread or JOIN one.
//!
//! ## A2A alignment
//!
//! The brief asks to align [`AgentCard`] and a message view with the `a2a-types` crate. That
//! crate (0.2) ships only prost/pbjson-generated protobuf types whose `metadata` fields are
//! `pbjson_types::Struct`, which do not round-trip through `rmp_serde`. So we mirror the A2A
//! spec field shapes here as plain serde structs (the canonical names: `name`, `description`,
//! `version`, `Role::{User, Agent}`, `Part::{Text, Data, ...}`) so a future A2A HTTP
//! front-end can map cleanly to/from `a2a_types::{AgentCard, Message, Part, Role}` without a
//! lossy translation. See the module deviation note in the component report.
