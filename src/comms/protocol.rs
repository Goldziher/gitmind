//! Wire protocol between comms clients (serve / CLI / hooks) and the broker daemon.
//!
//! JSON-RPC-shaped: [`CommsRequest`] is an internally-tagged `method` + `params` enum and
//! [`CommsResponse`] / [`CommsNotification`] mirror it, so a future A2A HTTP front-end can

//! transport the bodies are msgpack, but the serde shape is transport-agnostic.
//!
//! `proto_ver` negotiation in [`CommsRequest::Hello`] guards version skew: the daemon rejects
//! a client whose major protocol version it does not speak rather than silently
