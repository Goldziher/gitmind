//! Param and response types for the headless agent-shell `shell` tool.
//!
//! These drive the embedded rmux daemon (see [`crate::shells`]): spawn a
//! detached headless shell session, send stdin, capture the visible output, and
//! kill it. The whole module is gated on `feature = "shells"`.
//!
//! [`ShellParams`] is the one advertised shape — flat, with every per-mode field an optional
//! sibling. The per-mode structs below it are internal: the dispatcher in `helpers_shells` builds
//! them after validating the flat params, so the bodies keep their own typed inputs.
//!
//! Split into its own file to keep `types.rs` under the 1000-line cap.
