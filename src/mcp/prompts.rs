//! Reusable MCP prompt templates (`prompts/list` + `prompts/get`).
//!
//! Prompts are short, parameterized workflows that teach a client how to drive basemind's tools
//! for a common task — "get oriented in this repo", "trace a symbol", "review my uncommitted
//! changes". They complement the big `instructions` string in [`super`]`::get_info` with concrete,
//! selectable starting points, and their typed arguments (`symbol`, `path`) are the references the
//! `completion/complete` handler autocompletes (see [`super::completions`]).
//!
//! The router is built by the `#[prompt_router]` macro into `Self::prompt_router()` and stored on
//! [`super::BasemindServer`]; `list_prompts` / `get_prompt` in `super` delegate to it manually
//! (basemind hand-writes its `ServerHandler` impl for lean-mode, so it cannot use the blanket
//! `#[prompt_handler]` macro, which would regenerate `get_info`).
