## [Unreleased]

> **Minor release — cache rebuild, breaking changes, and a security fix.** Read *Breaking changes*
> and *Security* before upgrading. Almost all of this release is issue [#62]: a comms daemon reached
> 43.8 GiB RSS in about two minutes on an initial scan of a large monorepo and was OOM-killed,
> taking a VS Code renderer with it; under a 2 GiB `MemoryMax` the same scan died in about 50
> seconds.

### Breaking changes

1. **A workspace root must be a project.** It has to be a git repository, or a directory containing
   `basemind.toml`. Anything else is refused, and a filesystem or volume root is refused with no
   override at all. *If you hit this:* run `basemind init` in the directory (writes `basemind.toml`,
   the durable marker), or set `BASEMIND_ALLOW_ANY_ROOT=1` for that invocation. A root that already
   had a working-view index before the upgrade keeps working untouched.
2. **`[scan] extra_roots` is ignored unless `BASEMIND_ALLOW_EXTRA_ROOTS=1` is set** in the
   environment that launches basemind. *If you hit this:* export the variable where your MCP host or
   shell starts basemind — it deliberately cannot be granted from the scanned repository's own
   config.
3. **`[resources] max_footprint_mb = 0` now means *auto*, not *disabled*.** Every config generated
   before this release carries that value, so upgrading gains a memory ceiling rather than keeping
   none. *If you want the old behaviour:* write `max_footprint_mb = "off"`.
4. **Caches are wiped and rebuilt on the next scan.** `INDEX_PARTITION_REVISION` advances 4 → 5, so
   the Fjall secondary index is recreated on next open — fjall persists a keyspace's
   `max_memtable_size` at *create* time and ignores the create options for a keyspace that already
   exists, so the new per-keyspace sizing only takes effect on a recreated index. `RELEASE_MINOR`
   advances 25 → 26 with the release cut, which also invalidates the content-addressed blob cache
   and the git cache. *No action required:* rebuild is automatic, but the first scan after upgrading
   is a full one.
5. **Git history is no longer indexed for a workspace root that is merely a subdirectory of an
   enclosing repository.** *If you relied on it:* set `BASEMIND_GIT_DISCOVER_PARENTS=1`.

### Security

- **The daemon's streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint is no longer unauthenticated, and no longer starts by
  default.** Versions 0.23.0 through 0.25.2 bound `127.0.0.1:51786` unconditionally and gated
  requests only with a `Host` / `:authority` loopback check. That check defeats DNS rebinding and
  nothing else: any local process could open a TCP connection, send `Host: 127.0.0.1`, and reach the
  full shared tool router — which in the release build (`--features full`) includes the `shell`
  tool, enabled by default. Every process on the machine that could reach the port could therefore
  run commands as the daemon's user. Two changes close it:
  - The listener is opt-in. It binds only when `BASEMIND_ALLOW_HTTP` is truthy in the *daemon's*
    environment; unset, no socket exists. An environment variable rather than a config key because
    the daemon's environment belongs to whoever started it, whereas `basemind.toml` is authored by
    whoever wrote the repository.
  - When it does bind, every request on both routes (`/mcp` and `/ui`) must present a bearer token —
    32 bytes from the OS CSPRNG, drawn per daemon process, checked before routing and before any
    workspace is named or opened, compared without an early exit. The token is published as the
    second line of `<comms_dir>/http.addr`, created mode `0600` at `open` time so it is never
    briefly world-readable. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `?token=<token>` are both accepted
    (a browser navigating to `/ui` cannot set a header). `basemind daemon ensure` reports the token: on
    stderr for the human form, so the URL stays alone on stdout and `URL=$(basemind daemon ensure)`
    keeps working, and in the object for `--json`.
- **The Claude and Cursor plugin manifests no longer point at that port.** They now launch
  `scripts/mcp-launch.sh serve --root <project dir>` over stdio. A hard-coded loopback port is not
  addressable to a *process*: whichever process bound it first is what the client talked to, so a
  local squatter could silently intercept every tool call, and no credential on the real daemon can
  fix a client that never reaches it. The stdio relay is path-addressed and `0600`. The root is now
  passed explicitly instead of being inherited from the host's working directory — a failed
  expansion becomes a loud refusal from the root guard, where a wrong cwd was a silent scan of the
  wrong tree. `tests/plugin_manifest_smoke.rs` pins both properties, including that no manifest
  hard-codes `51786` anywhere.

### Added

- `[scan] max_candidates` (default `500_000`, `0` disables) aborts a scan from inside the walk once
  more than that many candidate files have been kept — before extraction, before any index write,
  and before the candidate list itself can grow to hundreds of megabytes. The error names the
  heaviest contributing directories by their first two path segments, so a vendored or generated
  tree that slipped past `.gitignore` is a one-line fix rather than an out-of-memory kill. ([#62])
- `BASEMIND_ALLOW_ANY_ROOT=1` accepts any directory as a workspace root, for the cases the new
  allow-list refuses. It does not override the refusal of a filesystem or volume root, and it
  applies only to the invocation that sets it: the index a hatched scan produces does not make the
  root permanently acceptable, so unsetting the variable refuses it again. ([#62])
- `[scan] max_candidates` also bounds the walk itself, not only what it keeps: a walk that visits a
  generous multiple of that many filesystem entries while accepting almost none of them now aborts
  with its own error, because a root broad enough to enumerate tens of millions of entries burns
  exactly the time and syscalls the ceiling exists to prevent. ([#62])
- basemind now reads the memory limit it is running under, not just its own usage: cgroup v2
  (`memory.max`, taking the minimum over the whole hierarchy, because systemd puts `MemoryMax` on
  a slice above the scope a process actually lives in), cgroup v1 (with its no-limit sentinel
  recognised as *no limit* rather than as an 8-exabyte ceiling), `/proc/meminfo` on a Linux box
  with no memory cgroup, `hw.memsize` on macOS, and `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` on Windows. Usage on
  Linux is a working set — reclaimable page cache is subtracted, as kubelet does — so having read
  a large repository no longer reads as being near the limit. A cgroup that sets no limit — the
  default for a plain `docker run` — falls back to total RAM rather than reporting no ceiling, and
  a cgroup limit larger than the machine is not treated as the binding constraint. Issue #62 was
  reported from a process running under a 2 GiB `MemoryMax` that had no way to know the limit
  existed. ([#62])
- `[resources] max_footprint_mb` accepts `"off"` and `"auto"` alongside an integer. ([#62])
- `[resources] max_map_cache_mb` (default `256`, `0` = unbounded) bounds the MCP read stack's
  decoded-outline cache, per workspace. Charged in **bytes**, not entries: a decoded outline spans
  three orders of magnitude (a ~1.4 KB median against a measured 697 KB maximum), so an entry cap
  would bound the count and not the footprint. A miss costs one blob read and never changes an
  answer. The code-graph memo is charged at half the same budget, and a read-only session's
  projected call / implementation indexes are charged against it too. ([#62])
- `[code_search] max_chunks_per_file` (default `2000`) caps how many chunks one source file may
  contribute to the search index, mirroring the document tier's `max_chunks_per_document`. A
  generated parser table or a checked-in bundle otherwise fans one file out into a chunk count
  bounded only by `[scan] max_file_bytes`, and every chunk costs a BM25 posting entry carrying its
  full term list, a LanceDB row, and — with `embed` on — an ONNX embed. An over-cap file is still
  chunked and cached (the `.chunk.msgpack` sidecar is written, so outline and grep are unaffected);
  what it loses is the per-chunk fan-out, with a warning naming the file. ([#62])
- `BASEMIND_NO_AUTOSPAWN=1` makes basemind connect to a daemon that is already running but never
  start one, so an operator can guarantee the daemon exists only inside a resource-controlled unit.
  A working systemd user unit — with install steps, the `environment.d` wiring, and the commands
  that verify the ceiling is real rather than merely configured — ships at
  `docs/systemd/basemind-comms.service`. Two deliberate exceptions: `basemind comms start` ignores
  the variable (an operator who typed a start command has stated the intent it withholds from
  implicit callers), and an already-live daemon is still used — connect-only means *do not start
  one*, not *do not use one*. ([#62])
- A scan leaves post-mortem evidence a `SIGKILL` cannot erase.
  `<workspace_cache_dir>/scan-inflight.json` is written before the pass starts and removed on
  `Drop`, so a surviving record proves the process
  never ran its destructors — the signature of an OOM kill, which is exactly the case the existing
  `last-fatal.json` structurally cannot report, because the code that writes it never runs. The
  record carries the pid, the build, the phase, the candidate count, and the root (a root of `/` is
  itself the finding). `basemind comms doctor` lists every such record whose pid is dead —
  filesystem-only, no RPC, so it stays usable on a wedged machine — and `--clear-fatal` now
  acknowledges stale scan records alongside the fatal-store record. A periodic `rss_mb` /
  `ceiling_mb` log line makes the growth curve reconstructable after the fact. ([#62])
- `BASEMIND_GIT_DELTA_CACHE_BYTES` overrides the per-`Repository` delta-base (pack) cache bound;
  `0` disables the cache. gix's default when `core.deltaBaseCacheLimit` is unset is 96 MiB **per
  thread-local `Repository`**, i.e. per rayon worker during a git-history build — roughly 3 GiB of
  decoded delta bases on a 32-core host that nothing in basemind accounted for. basemind now sets
  the key to 8 MiB, as a CLI-precedence override so a repository-local `core.deltaBaseCacheLimit`
  cannot raise the bound we set for our own protection. Undersizing it costs re-decoding, never a
  wrong answer. ([#62])
- `BASEMIND_ALLOW_HTTP` gates the daemon's streamable-HTTP MCP front-end — see *Security*. ([#62])

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a workspace root must now be a git repository or contain `basemind.toml`. basemind
  opens a root read-write and indexes everything beneath it, and root discovery falls back to the
  starting directory, so an MCP host launched at `/` could previously hand the daemon the whole
  filesystem — which is how a scan reached 43.8 GiB and was OOM-killed. `basemind init` and
  `BASEMIND_ALLOW_ANY_ROOT` are the escape hatches, and a root that already had an index on disk
  before the upgrade is grandfathered so upgrades do not break a working setup. The guard resolves
  the root — collapsing `..`, following symlinks — before deciding, and hands the resolved path to
  whatever opens the store, so a path such as `/..` can no longer be checked as a subdirectory and
  opened as the filesystem root. It now also covers `basemind admin rescan` (and the `admin` MCP
  tool), which walks the whole working tree in-process, and the daemon's git-history sync. There are
  three refusals, and the error text names every way out of the one you hit: *not a project* (a
  plain directory — overridable), *filesystem root* (`/`, `C:\`, a UNC share root — never
  overridable, by any marker, hatch or pre-existing index), and *unresolvable* (relative, missing or
  unreadable, so the guard cannot decide about it at all). It is a misconfiguration guard, not an
  authorization boundary: it does not defend against a caller who controls the process's arguments
  or environment. ([#62])
- The grandfather clause reads an explicit record rather than inferring consent from a side effect.
  The guard writes `root-admission.json` into the root's workspace cache dir, stamped
  `pre_existing_index` (a standing admission that survives with no env var — the upgrade path) or
  `env_hatch` (never a standing admission). Without it, the mere existence of a working-view index
  was proof of admission, which made a single `BASEMIND_ALLOW_ANY_ROOT=1 basemind scan` a
  *permanent* whitelist for that root: the scan the hatch authorized left behind the very file the
  next hatch-free run would accept as evidence. The first verdict is the standing one and is never
  overwritten, and the write is best-effort — a failed write only degrades the guard to its
  index-means-admitted behaviour and never fails a scan. ([#62])
- The HTTP transport's `?root=` now runs the same root discovery the CLI does, so naming a
  subdirectory of a repository attaches to that repository instead of being refused — the two
  front-ends previously disagreed about what a root is. ([#62])
- Excluded directories are now pruned during the walk instead of being filtered per file after the
  walker has already descended into them, so a non-gitignored `node_modules` is no longer traversed
  and stat'd in full. The indexed set is unchanged. This also fixes the Linux watcher, which
  previously registered inotify watches inside trees it was excluding. ([#62])
- **Breaking:** `[scan] extra_roots` now requires the operator to set `BASEMIND_ALLOW_EXTRA_ROOTS=1`
  in the environment. That key names directories *outside* the repository but is read from the
  scanned repository's own `basemind.toml`, so cloning and indexing a repo was enough to make
  basemind walk whatever it named — `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws` — and surface the contents through the
  `code grep` / `search` tools. The process environment is the one input a cloned repository cannot
  write, so it is what the grant hangs on. Extra roots also now count toward `[scan] max_candidates`
  (they were appended after the ceiling was evaluated), are refused when they resolve to a
  filesystem or volume root, follow symlinks only when `[scan] follow_symlinks` is on (it was
  hard-coded on), and stop when a scan is cancelled. ([#62])
- The scanner bounds what it stages into the index by **bytes** rather than by file count. BM25
  keyword postings — one entry per (term, chunk), staged on essentially every scan — previously
  counted toward no limit at all and could not force a commit; they now participate in the byte
  budget.

  This is the single change that most explains issue #62's number. The old bound counted *files*,
  and postings were staged without touching that counter, so the one structure that grows with the
  product of files and distinct terms was the one structure nothing bounded. The other fixes in this
  release matter, but they are smaller than their prominence suggests: reverting the chunked drive
  loop to its previous whole-corpus form, measured at both arms on a 4 000-file corpus, moves peak
  RSS by ~38 MiB — about 10 KiB per file — because a file's postings are already cleared inside the
  worker before its result is returned. Worth having at monorepo scale, but not the 43.8 GiB.
  Directory pruning is a walk-cost win rather than a memory one. Stated explicitly so nobody
  re-derives the priorities from scratch next time. ([#62])
- **Breaking:** `[resources] max_footprint_mb = 0` now means **auto**, not disabled. An existing
  config that carries the old default — as every config generated before this release does —
  therefore gains a memory ceiling on upgrade rather than keeping none. Auto budgets 75% of an
  enforced cgroup limit or 50% of total machine RAM, whichever the platform reports, floored at
  512 MiB. Write `max_footprint_mb = "off"` to restore the previous behaviour, or a positive
  integer to state a ceiling explicitly. The gate remains best-effort — it parks workers and then
  admits anyway after five seconds rather than failing a scan — so the change shapes peak memory
  and cannot make a scan that used to succeed start failing. A long-lived daemon shipping with its
  only memory bound disabled by default is what made 43.8 GiB reachable. ([#62])
- The footprint gate works on Linux and Windows, not only macOS. Its sampler was
  `sysres::phys_footprint`, a Darwin-only metric returning `None` everywhere else, so on the
  machine that filed #62 the ceiling could not have throttled anything even if it had been
  configured. ([#62])
- The MCP read stack no longer keeps every file's decoded outline resident for the process lifetime.
  The old `MapCache` was the only `O(total symbols)` structure with permanent lifetime — plus a
  second full copy of every import, plus a deep clone of the whole map on every watcher batch, times
  up to 16 hot workspaces in one daemon. It splits into a permanent `O(files)` symbol-free index
  view and a byte-charged read-through LRU governed by `[resources] max_map_cache_mb`, keyed by
  content hash so one cache is safely shared across snapshots and identical files share an entry.
  Building the view now decodes zero outline blobs — it projects the index and probes blob existence
  in parallel, one stat per file instead of a full read and decode. A read-only session whose
  projections are truncated by the budget reports it through the existing lifecycle notice with
  `retry: false`, because rerunning cannot widen a budget. ([#62])
- Per-keyspace Fjall memtable sizing replaces the 64 MiB default on all 17 keyspaces: 16 MiB for the
  BM25 posting list (the densest writer by far), 8 MiB for the secondary indexes the scanner
  rewrites once per file, less for the keyspaces a scan barely touches — all within fjall's
  recommended 8–64 MiB band. This is what `INDEX_PARTITION_REVISION` 4 → 5 exists to force: fjall
  persists `max_memtable_size` at keyspace *create* time and ignores the create options on reopen,
  so an index built by an earlier build would have kept the 64 MiB default forever. ([#62])
- The staged-byte counter now models fjall's real per-entry cost (`64 + heap(key) + heap(value)`,
  where a payload of 20 bytes or fewer inlines and anything larger carries an 8-byte refcount
  header). Charging `key.len() + value.len()` undercounted what a `WriteBatch` actually holds by
  2–3×, so both the per-worker batch budget and the process-wide staging ceiling meant something
  other than what they said. It remains a deliberate lower bound: allocator size-class rounding and
  `Vec` growth slack are not modelled. ([#62])
- The resolve pass no longer materialises the whole corpus. It previously built every file's
  resolved-reference edge set at once — one edge per resolved identifier use — held them through
  fact staging, then transformed rather than dropped them. The per-file edge set now cannot escape
  the file that produced it (there is no field to retain it in, so keeping the corpus set is a
  compile error), and the serial index writers gained the same byte bounds the parallel workers
  already had, closing the last staging path with no byte bound at all. ([#62])
- `basemind scan` / `rescan` stream each file's line as the scan absorbs it instead of accumulating
  one result per file for the whole repository just to print it afterwards. `ScanReport` now carries
  the summary statistics only; a caller that wants the old whole-corpus vector asks for it
  explicitly. ([#62])
- **Breaking:** git history is no longer indexed for a workspace root that is a subdirectory of the
  repository git discovery lands on. Those commits are addressed by paths that do not exist under
  the root, and walking them costs the whole ancestor object database — a 4.4k-file subdirectory of
  a monorepo was driving gix over 275 MiB of packs and 101 655 objects. Discovery itself is
  unchanged (ascent is what lets `basemind scan src/` lift to the repository root); only the
  history integration is gated. `git init` in the directory, or
  `BASEMIND_GIT_DISCOVER_PARENTS=1`, restores the old behaviour. ([#62])
- The Claude and Cursor plugin manifests launch `scripts/mcp-launch.sh serve --root <project dir>`
  over stdio instead of dialling `http://127.0.0.1:51786/mcp?root=…` — see *Security*. ([#62])

### Fixed

- A scan of a repository holding *exactly* `[scan] max_candidates` candidate files could abort
  spuriously: the ceiling was checked against every walk entry, so once the candidate list reached
  the cap the next directory node or non-indexed file tripped it. Whether it fired depended on
  readdir order. ([#62])
- The "largest contributors" list in a `max_candidates` abort routinely named the wrong directory.
  The tally stopped at the breach and `ignore::Walk` is depth-first in readdir order, so a repo
  with `aaa/` (30 files) and `zzz/` (5000) was told to exclude `aaa`. The walk now surveys a
  bounded number of further entries before erroring, buckets by the first *two* path segments so
  monorepos get an actionable name, and groups root-level files instead of listing them one by
  one. ([#62])
- A draining daemon can now interrupt a running file walk. Previously cancellation was only checked
  once the walk had finished, so a runaway scan could not be stopped. ([#62])
- `[resources] max_concurrent_documents` was parsed and never consumed — the setting did nothing. A
  counting semaphore now enforces it. It is distinct from the footprint gate, which reacts to memory
  *already* allocated: a document extraction's spike (decoded page buffers, OCR bitmaps, an
  embedding batch) lands faster than the sampler can see it, so this bounds how many spikes may
  overlap before the first one starts. ([#62])
- Staging an entry that failed returned early without running the commit check, so bytes the failed
  upsert had already staged drifted out of the ledger permanently. ([#62])
- Commit cadence no longer collapses at high core counts. The process-wide staging ceiling had no
  hysteresis, so cadence scaled as `ceiling / workers` — a commit per file on a many-core host. A
  1 MiB floor on that branch bounds the worst case at about 128 MiB of resident staged index at 64
  workers, and no core count now commits more often than the 8-worker cadence. ([#62])

### Known limitations

- **Two concurrent full-tree scans of one workspace share one `scan-inflight.json`.** The second
  scan's record overwrites the first's, and the first scan's completion then removes the file while
  the second is still running — a window in which a genuine hard death would leave no breadcrumb.
  This is not reachable today (the daemon serialises a workspace's scans behind its store lock, and
  a `serve` boot's deferred and inline passes are sequential), and a per-pid filename would trade
  the window for records that accumulate and never get cleaned, so the single-file design stands.
  Recorded because the evidence is only trustworthy if its gaps are known. ([#62])
- **A memory ceiling on the daemon can only be enforced by whoever *starts* it.** basemind spawns the
  daemon detached with `setsid(2)`, which changes the session and the process group and **not** the
  cgroup. On Linux a child stays in the spawning process's cgroup, so a daemon auto-spawned from an
  interactive shell lands in that shell's scope — outside whatever `MemoryMax` an operator
  configured on a basemind unit — and a process cannot move its own children into a cgroup it does
  not control. There is no in-process fix, and none is claimed. The answer is
  `BASEMIND_NO_AUTOSPAWN=1` everywhere plus a unit that starts the daemon itself; see
  `docs/systemd/basemind-comms.service`, which includes the two commands that check whether the
  ceiling is real rather than merely configured. ([#62])
- **`[resources] max_footprint_mb` is advisory, not structural.** The gate parks workers at admit
  points while the process is over the ceiling and then admits anyway after five seconds, trading an
  overshoot for guaranteed forward progress. It shapes the peak; it cannot enforce an invariant the
  allocator will not, and it cannot make a scan that used to succeed start failing. The structural
  bounds this release adds are the ones that abort or truncate: `[scan] max_candidates`,
  `[code_search] max_chunks_per_file`, `[resources] max_map_cache_mb`, and the byte budget on staged
  index entries.
- **`[scan] max_candidates` does not bound bytes read or index size**, and does not apply to the
  `Staged` / `Rev` scan sources, which enumerate from git rather than from a walk.
- **Directory pruning is a walk-cost win, not a memory win.** Pruned files were already rejected by
  the path filter and never entered the candidate list. What pruning removes is the descent and the
  per-file `stat` — real, and the reason the Linux watcher stopped registering inotify watches
  inside excluded trees — but no claim is made that it reduced peak memory.
- **`SCANNER_STACK_SIZE` (256 MiB, `src/scanner_file.rs`) is not a leak and was deliberately left
  alone.** It is the per-worker stack reservation for the scanner's thread pool: lazily-committed
  virtual address space that never counts toward RSS or a cgroup limit. Shrinking it to "save
  memory" would save nothing and would reintroduce stack-overflow aborts on deeply nested syntax
  trees.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- `basemind comms doctor --probe` asks each comms daemon whether it can actually serve and reports
  the verdict per row (`serving` / `LIVE BUT FAILING` / `LIVE BUT NOT RESPONDING`). The default
  report stays RPC-free, so it remains safe to run on a wedged machine, and now states which
  question it answered: process liveness from the pidfile registry, not health.
- A daemon that hits an unrecoverable store error records it to `<comms_dir>/last-fatal.json`
  before exiting. `comms doctor` reports that record — the failing method, pid, build, and age —
  so the evidence outlives the process; `--clear-fatal` acknowledges it.

### Changed

- Dependency refresh: `xberg` repinned to the current 1.1.0 revision, `crawlberg` 1.4.0 → 1.4.2,
  `fjall` 3.1.9 → 3.1.10, `jsonschema` 0.51 → 0.52, `lru` 0.18.2 → 0.18.3, `mach2` 0.6 → 0.7,
  `tree-sitter-language-pack` 1.15.8 → 1.15.12, and `liter-llm` 1.18.1 → 1.18.4.

### Fixed

- A comms daemon whose store became permanently unusable held the singleton forever: it kept the
  flock and the socket, so its pid stayed live and no replacement could take over, while every
  request failed identically. It now releases the lock and exits non-zero on the first such error,
  so the next `comms start` gets a clean daemon ([#61]).
- `basemind comms stop` hung indefinitely against a daemon wedged before its accept loop, because
  the connect never returned — the documented recovery path blocked on the very daemon it was
  meant to reclaim. Both stop paths now time-box the RPC and escalate to the pid. A daemon that
  answers with a deliberate refusal (`daemon_busy`, protecting the clients attached to it) is
  reported and left running, never terminated.
- `comms status` reported `threads: 0` when the store could not be read, which is indistinguishable
  from a healthy empty broker. It now surfaces the store error instead.

[#61]: https://github.com/Goldziher/basemind/issues/61

## [0.25.1] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Dependency refresh: `xberg` repinned to the current 1.1.0 revision (EPUB chapter/metadata loss,
  PDF reading-order and CCITT image decoding, and XML/MathML hardening fixes on the document
  extraction path), `crawlberg` 1.3.3 → 1.4.0, `gix` 0.87.0 → 0.87.1, `jsonschema` 0.50 → 0.51, and
  `tree-sitter-language-pack` 1.15.7 → 1.15.8.

### Fixed

- The Linux file watcher no longer aborts when a directory cannot be read (permission denied).
  inotify watches are now registered directory-by-directory, pruned by the same gitignore +
  exclude-glob filters a full scan uses, with registration failures downgraded to warnings.
  Directories created after startup are re-armed on create events, and the per-directory scheme is
  gated to Linux (macOS/Windows keep the single recursive call to avoid an FSEvents startup
  regression).

## [0.25.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- MCP stdio sessions now reconnect through a persistent protocol-aware relay when the shared daemon
  restarts, replaying initialization and returning retryable errors for interrupted requests.
- Agent comms now auto-register presence, deliver mailbox notices alongside ordinary MCP responses,
  notify scoped agents about discoverable threads, accept unambiguous short message references, and
  expose lifecycle status plus dry-run/apply retention cleanup.
- Document extraction uses xberg 1.1 chunk content, offsets, language metadata, bounded extraction
  time/page limits, and basemind's shared batch embedding path. Binary builds pin the unreleased
  xberg source to an exact public Git revision for reproducibility.

### Changed

- **Cache schema advances to 25.** Existing machine-global index, blob, and comms cache state is
  rebuilt on the next scan after upgrading.
- Cache GC repairs corrupt or old rebuildable views instead of aborting the global sweep, enforces
  the disk budget against rebuildable workspace data, and records degraded GC health.
- Comms retention now bounds messages, archived threads, inactive agents, claims, and total threads;
  stale-agent cleanup removes routing state atomically while preserving authored history.
- Heavy MCP work is admitted through a daemon-wide concurrency limit and returns a retryable
  `server_busy` response under sustained load.

### Fixed

- Inbox cursors paginate independently per thread without repeats or undercounted unread totals.
- Message reads and acknowledgements enforce thread membership.
- Cancelled inbox waits release their subscriptions immediately, and default MCP identities no
  longer collide across concurrent sessions in one workspace.
- Standalone scan and MCP processes no longer hang during shutdown when Fjall's background worker
  teardown encounters the upstream database-drop deadlock.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Interactive UI over HTTP + the `ui` tool (ADR-0006).** A new `ui` MCP tool (and `query ui` CLI, in
  full parity) renders the code-graph and returns a URL to view and drive it: a live
  `http://<addr>/ui?root=…` page served by the basemind daemon's HTTP front-end when one is reachable,
  otherwise a `file://` URL to the self-contained offline export (which the tool always writes). The
  served page is the same zero-dependency interactive canvas as `display`/`graph_export html`, so a
  browser — or an agent driving one — can navigate, search, pan/zoom, and screenshot it. `open: false`
  returns the URL without launching a viewer (agents/tests). The daemon's streamable-HTTP front-end
  gained a `GET /ui` route alongside `POST /mcp` (both behind the `comms` feature). Both routes are
  loopback-only: on a loopback bind the front-end rejects any request whose `Host`/`:authority` is not
  a loopback name (DNS-rebinding protection), skipped only on an explicit non-loopback bind.
- **Desktop UI launch path (ADR-0006, first slice).** A `basemind ui` subcommand launches the desktop
  UI front-end (`basemind-ui`) by re-exec'ing the sibling binary built alongside `basemind` —
  mirroring how `basemind agent` launches `basemind-tui`. Both launchers are behind the `desktop-ui`
  and `agent-tui` features and ship in no release archive yet (see Changed); build them locally to
  use them. This slice wires the launch path; today the binary opens the offline, self-contained
  interactive HTML code graph (the same ADR-0005 payload the `display` tool produces). The resident Tauri window that
  drives the agent client/event/command seam lands behind a `desktop` feature in a later slice, so
  default builds stay free of the per-platform webview dependency.
- **Inline rationale extraction (ADR-0009).** L1 extraction now classifies source comments carrying
  `WHY:` / `RATIONALE:` / `NOTE:` / `TODO:` / `FIXME:` / `HACK:` / `XXX:` / `SAFETY:` markers (and
  bare comments citing `ADR`/`RFC` decision records) into `FileMapL1.rationale`, which the read-side
  graph build consumes to emit `Annotates` / `Cites` edges. Blob-compatible (`#[serde(default)]`); no
  schema bump.
- **Single-daemon guarantees + leak safeguards.** The comms daemon now takes an exclusive
  single-owner lock (`daemon.lock`) *before* binding its socket, so a redundant daemon on the same
  comms dir converges (exits 0) instead of racing — uniform across Unix and Windows. Every live daemon
  registers a pidfile under `<data_home>/daemons/`, and a new machine-wide ceiling
  (`BASEMIND_MAX_DAEMONS`, default 8) **refuses** to spawn past it rather than letting daemons pile up.
  New `basemind comms doctor` lists every live daemon (pid / comms dir / version / uptime, pruning dead
  entries) and flags a pile-up; `basemind comms stop --all` reclaims them all in one call.

### Changed

- **Cache schema advances to 24.** Existing machine-global index, blob, and comms cache state is
  rebuilt on the next scan after upgrading.
- **Release dependencies are current.** `tree-sitter-language-pack` is updated to 1.14.3,
  `crawlberg` to 1.1.4, and `liter-llm` to 1.16.0. The optional LSP bincode integration is pinned to
  2.0.1 because the published 3.0.0 crate is an intentionally non-compiling placeholder.
- **Agent shell sessions now default to headless presentation.** Background MCP/CLI work no longer
  opens terminal tabs unless `[shells].visual` explicitly selects `current` or `window`.
- **The two interactive front-ends are held back from releases.** The agent TUI (`basemind-tui`,
  ratatui) and the desktop UI (`basemind-ui`, tauri) are not ready to ship, so the release archive now
  contains the `basemind` binary alone, and the launcher subcommands that would re-exec them sit
  behind two new root-crate features, `agent-tui` and `desktop-ui`, which `full` deliberately omits.
  A released `basemind` therefore never advertises a command whose sibling binary is absent from the
  archive. Neither crate is affected otherwise: both remain workspace members, both still build under
  `cargo build --workspace`, the `basemind-tui` replay/PTY suite still runs in CI, and a local
  `cargo install --path . --features full,agent-tui,desktop-ui` still gets both launchers. Nothing was
  published from these crates before — both carry `publish = false` — so no crates.io surface changes.
- **Daemons self-reap sooner to stop the process/memory leak class.** The idle-reap default drops
  from 30 min to 10 min, and a new **bootstrap reaper** self-terminates a daemon that no client ever
  connects to within ~2 min (env `BASEMIND_COMMS_BOOTSTRAP_SECS`) — catching the spawn-and-abandon
  shape (a test or script that ran `daemon ensure` then exited) that previously left a daemon, and its
  tens of threads, resident. Behavioural only; no schema/`RELEASE_MINOR` bump. Test binaries pin a fast
  reap so a parallel `cargo test` no longer accumulates one lingering daemon per binary.
- **BREAKING: `basemind-agent`'s LLM-facing tool names follow the domain consolidation.** The agent
  registered its code-map tools under the pre-consolidation flat names, so the model saw one
  vocabulary and the MCP surface another. They are now `domain_mode` in bare snake_case:
  `outline` → `code_outline`, `search_symbols` → `code_symbols`, `find_references` →
  `code_references`, `find_callers` → `code_callers`, `workspace_grep` → `code_grep`, `call_graph` →
  `graph_calls`, `recent_changes` → `git_recent`, `blame_symbol` → `git_blame_symbol`, `diff_file` →
  `git_diff`. `shell_exec` is unchanged — it is the agent's own tool, not an MCP domain. The
  underscore rather than the MCP surface's colon is a provider constraint, not a style choice:
  Anthropic, OpenAI and Google all validate tool names against `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$`, so
  `code:outline` is not a legal name to register. Only saved conversations that replay a raw tool
  name are affected. The token-savings estimator now rewrites the agent spelling to the MCP
  telemetry key at the boundary, keyed off the real mode vocabulary in `src/mcp/mode.rs`, so each
  baseline carries a single spelling — previously it carried both, and dropping either would have
  silently zeroed the agent TUI's "tokens saved" readout instead of failing a test.
- **`call_graph` is re-expressed over the shared `codegraph`.** The tool no longer maintains its own
  call scan; it projects the resolved `Calls` edges of the shared, memoized graph the other graph
  tools already read. One user-visible consequence: a call whose callee does not resolve to an
  in-repo function-like definition (an external/library call) no longer surfaces as an empty-`sites`
  callee node — `call_graph` now reports only resolved, in-repo call relationships. The `callers`
  direction is unchanged. Read-side only; no blob/index schema change.
- **BREAKING: the 85-tool MCP surface collapses into nine domain tools, each dispatched by a
  required `mode`.** Hosts defer MCP tools and surface them only through keyword search, so every
  extra tool name competed for the same query, and GH #50 showed one layer's schema defect took the
  whole registry down with it — the comms layer's schema broke code navigation, despite the two
  sharing nothing. Nine dense tools (`code`, `graph`, `git`, `memory`, `admin`, `web`, `agents`,
  `workspace`, `shell`) retrieve better than eighty-five thin ones, and each remaining description
  now carries the vocabulary an agent actually searches for. `mode` is required and never defaults —
  a default would let an agent omit it and silently get the wrong operation, which looks like an
  empty result rather than an error. The CLI collapses onto the same nine group names as real clap
  subcommands (`basemind code outline`, not a `--mode` flag), so every operation keeps its own
  `--help` and argument validation; `tests/cli_parity.rs` now asserts a strict `(domain, mode)`
  bijection between the two surfaces. All 85 operations survive with no deprecated shims — a name
  that still answered to the old spelling would keep competing in deferred-tool search, which is the
  cost this removes. Landed over four commits (`88cd9da` web, `6af6268` admin/memory/workspace,
  `36919a4` git/graph, `02bf4a5` code/agents/shell); design and trade-offs in
  [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-mcp-tool-surface-redesign.md). Two costs taken deliberately: no
  `output_schema` on any of the nine tools (each domain's modes return different response shapes,
  and SEP-2106 allows exactly one schema per tool), and per-tool annotations coarsen to the union of
  a domain's modes, resolving toward the side effect (e.g. `shell` advertises `destructive_hint`
  because `kill` is one of its modes, and `graph` advertises `read_only_hint: false` because
  `display`/`open` launch a viewer, even though seven of its nine modes are pure reads).

  Anyone with a saved prompt, script, or pinned tool name against the old surface needs the
  replacement below — `<old tool>` is now `<domain>` mode `<mode>`, and every CLI invocation moves
  from its old subcommand path to the new one. `basemind registry` is also renamed `basemind
  workspace` (its subcommands are unchanged), and `basemind comms` now holds only the broker
  daemon's own lifecycle (`daemon` / `start` / `stop` / `status` / `doctor`) — the agent-facing verbs
  it used to carry (`register`, `agents`, `thread-*`, `join`, `leave`, `members`, `post`, `history`,
  `read`, `inbox`, `wait`, plus a new `ack`) moved to `basemind agents`.

### Fixed

- **Recycling the shared daemon no longer disconnects other agents.** `basemind comms stop` now
  refuses with `daemon_busy` while another live relay is connected, instead of entering a bounded
  drain that severed every stdio MCP transport after ten seconds and left hosts permanently showing
  `Transport closed`. Once the other sessions exit, the same stop request succeeds normally.
- **EndNote XML is rejected until xberg ships its quick-xml fix.** The document scanner now blocks
  `.enw` / `application/x-endnote+xml` before xberg 1.0.14 can route untrusted input through
  biblib 0.4.3's vulnerable quick-xml 0.37 attribute parser (RUSTSEC-2026-0194). The narrow guard is
  tracked for removal in [xberg #1398](https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/issues/1398).
- **Resolved imported calls could remain inferred in code graphs.** The reference index now prefers
  a terminal cross-file definition over the local import binding, and code-graph proof matches the
  resolver's identifier byte within the outline symbol span. Python callers and goto-definition now
  agree on the exported target.
- **Cache budget enforcement could remain over its configured limit.** Eviction now prefers cold
  workspaces but falls back to hot ones when required, reclaims newly orphaned blobs in the same
  pass, and remeasures the actual cache footprint before selecting another workspace.
- **Starved or failed daemon GC cycles were visible only in logs.** `cache_stats.last_gc` now records
  the latest attempt status, timestamp, actionable diagnosis, consecutive degraded-cycle count,
  and budget outcome while preserving counters from the last successful sweep.
- **Content-addressed blobs no longer consume raw msgpack size on disk (issue #49).** New `.fm`,
  `.doc`, `.rref`, and `.chunk` blobs use zstd-1 envelopes. Filemap L1/L2 frames remain independent
  so outline reads do not decompress calls, and chunk embedding metadata stays plain for cheap cache
  validation. Existing uncompressed blobs remain readable and are rewritten when next produced.
- **Agent shell capture could return an empty screen for a successful command.** The snapshot-only
  path dropped the first row for fresh CLI clients and let rmux's dead-pane row push short output
  out of `lines=N` captures. Capture now reads retained history, removes terminal synthetic and
  outer blank rows while preserving interior spacing, and returns a bounded recent tail, so a
  completed one-line command remains observable until `kill`.
- **Shared shell sessions could start in another workspace.** Relative or omitted `cwd` values were
  interpreted from the machine-global rmux daemon's original process directory. Spawn now anchors
  every command to the calling workspace root, and accepts `cwd = "."` as that root.
- **A transient pane inspection could make `shell list` fail globally.** The daemon now preserves
  the known session list and conservatively reports liveness when rmux cannot provide one pane-state
  snapshot, rather than making every session undiscoverable. Its idle reaper uses strict liveness
  separately, so persistent inspection failure cannot pin the daemon forever.
- **A resident daemon running different code at the same version was invisible.** After a local
  rebuild or `cargo install --path .`, the version check compares only `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, so the
  daemon left over from the previous build passes every test and is reused — answering with stale
  code while the newly installed binary sits unused. `basemind comms status` now reports a `build=`
  identity (a hash of the running executable, so two builds differ exactly when their bytes do) and
  warns explicitly when the daemon's build differs from the binary asking. The build id is
  diagnostic only: it deliberately does not trigger takeover, because two same-version binaries at
  different paths would then reclaim the socket from each other indefinitely.
- **`admin rescan` reported a refreshed document in no bucket at all.** A rescan that re-indexed a
  changed PDF/Office/HTML file returned `scanned: 3, skipped_unchanged: 2, updated: 0` — the
  document lane's work was counted by the scanner but dropped from the response, which read as
  "nothing happened" for documents users. The response now carries `docs_indexed`. Indexed data was
  never stale; only the accounting was.
- **`agents post` accepted an empty `body` and stored a message with nothing to read.** An empty
  string is now refused with an error naming the mode and pointing at the subject-only form; omitting
  `body` entirely stays legal.
- **The machine registry never retired a row.** Workspaces were recorded on registration and nothing
  ever removed them, so every throwaway checkout and test tempdir accumulated forever and buried the
  live repos `workspace workspaces` exists to surface. The daemon now prunes rows whose path is gone,
  once at startup and on its hourly maintenance pass.

## [0.23.1] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **`code semantic` silently returned nothing on a reader session.** Both non-vector retrieval lanes
  — BM25 keyword and exact symbol-name — read fjall, whose directory lock is exclusive, so any
  session that is not the daemon opens the store without an index and both lanes returned an empty
  vector. That empty was indistinguishable from "searched and found nothing": the call succeeded, in
  microseconds, with `hits: []`. A reader session now forwards the two lanes to the daemon (rankings
  only — chunk bodies still come from content-addressed blobs the caller can already read), and a
  daemon-hosted session reaches the same index straight through the host seam rather than dialling
  the daemon it runs inside. When a lane genuinely cannot run, the response carries
  `degraded_lanes` + `degraded_reason` and partial results are labelled as partial; when no lane can
  run at all the call is an error that says so, never a bare `[]`. Keyword-lane hits also carry
  their `matched_lanes` / `keyword_rank` provenance, which only the fused path used to set.
- **The `multi-agent-room` skill now ships to every plugin tree.** `scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh`
  carried a hand-maintained list of nine skills while `skills/` held ten, so `multi-agent-room` was
  copied into the Hermes bundle (generated separately by ai-rulez) but never into the Codex, Cursor
  or opencode plugins — while the `agent-comms` rule those plugins *do* ship tells the agent to
  consult it. The skill and command lists are now derived from the canonical `skills/` and
  `commands/` trees, so adding either ships it everywhere instead of only where someone remembered.
- **Documentation named tools and commands that no longer exist.** The consolidation swept the
  README, `llms.txt`, `docs/`, `skills/` and the plugin manifests but missed the `website/` docs
  site, the `pre-tool-guard` hook (which suggested `search_symbols` / `find_references` /
  `list_files` on every Grep and Glob), and `basemind git blame-file` in the README quickstart.
  Every `basemind <domain> <mode>` command now appearing in the docs or plugin trees is verified to
  resolve against the built binary.
- **Runaway daemon spawning under `cargo test` (fork bomb).** `spawn_detached_daemon` re-exec'd
  `std::env::current_exe()` with `comms daemon` appended. Under a test harness that executable is
  libtest, which reads the appended words as a **test-name filter** and re-runs the whole suite — and
  every test in that re-run reaching the spawn forked another generation. A single run reached 5610
  orphaned daemons and 8256 processes, at which point `fork` itself began failing. The machine-wide
  ceiling could not contain it because `init_isolated_cache` minted a fresh `$BASEMIND_DATA_HOME` in
  every process, so each generation counted an empty registry. Now the spawn resolves a real
  `basemind` binary or refuses: a harness is redirected to the sibling `target/<profile>/basemind`,
  and `BASEMIND_DAEMON_BINARY` is the explicit override. The isolated test cache is stamped with a
  marker and re-adopted by child processes, so one registry — and one ceiling — covers the whole
  process tree, while an unmarked `$BASEMIND_DATA_HOME` (a developer's real cache) is never adopted.
- **Blank statusline in global-cache mode.** With the index living in the machine-global cache there
  is no in-repo `.basemind/` for the shell statusline to read, so it fell back to a permanent "no
  index" hint even on a freshly-scanned repo. `basemind statusline` gains a `--root <path>` mode that
  renders the rich per-repo line (file count · scan age · today's calls · tokens saved) from a cheap
  new `status.json` sidecar plus the `telemetry.jsonl` tail — never opening the Fjall index, so it is
  safe to refresh every few seconds. The sidecar is written after every working-view scan/rescan and
  is additive/best-effort (a missing or unrecognized-schema sidecar degrades to the "no index" hint).
  No blob/index schema change.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-07-31

Minor release: **`.basemind/` is wiped and rebuilt on the next `basemind scan`** (`RELEASE_MINOR`
22 → 23). Rebuild is automatic from source; no action needed.

### Added

- **Streamable-HTTP MCP transport (rmcp 3.0, SEP-2567), hosted by the comms daemon.** The single
  machine-global daemon now serves the rmcp router over a stateless loopback-HTTP front-end
  (`127.0.0.1:51786` by default, `BASEMIND_HTTP_ADDR` to override; the bound address is published to
  `<comms_dir>/http.addr`) in addition to its Unix-socket relay. HTTP-native clients dial
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp?root=<repo>` directly — no per-session server process. `basemind
  daemon ensure` brings the daemon + transport up and prints the URL.
- **Structured tool output (SEP-2106).** Every tool advertises an `outputSchema` and returns
  `structuredContent` alongside the text mirror, so compliant clients get typed results.
- **`tools/list` / `prompts/list` cache hints (SEP-2549)** — the tool surface is static per process,
  so the daemon advertises a TTL + public cache scope and clients stop re-listing every session.
- **Long-running tools as pollable tasks (SEP-2663).** Slow tools (`rescan`, and the feature-gated
  `search_documents` / `web_scrape` / `web_crawl` / `web_map`) run as cancellable tasks when the
  client declares the Tasks capability; other clients keep the synchronous path.

### Changed

- **rmcp 2.2 → 3.0**, plus `arrow`, `lancedb`, `xberg`, `crawlberg`, and `jsonschema` dependency
  bumps.
- **`basemind serve` is now a thin stdio↔daemon relay, not a server in its own right.** It ensures
  the daemon (the sole rmcp host and Fjall writer) and byte-pumps stdin/stdout to the daemon's relay
  socket. Every stdio MCP client keeps working with no config change; the daemon outlives any single
  client. The Claude Code and Cursor plugins switch to the HTTP transport (`type: http`) and dial the
  daemon directly.

### Fixed

- **The MCP transport "drops and never returns" hang.** `serve` previously fell back to an
  in-process stdio server whose lifetime was bound to the stdin pipe, so a slow tool call that timed
  out and closed stdin killed the whole server — and it did not come back until the client respawned
  it. The daemon-hosted model decouples server lifetime from any single connection: a dropped client
  ends only the throwaway relay (or a single stateless HTTP request), and the warm daemon serves the
  next connection immediately.
- **Document re-embed loop follow-ups (issue #44).** Three residual thrash paths on the document
  tier are closed: (1) a hosted rescan now honors the daemon drain token, so `comms stop` / SIGTERM
  interrupts a mid-scan instead of letting it run to completion; (2) a reused document blob has its
  mtime refreshed on every scan, so the blob GC's grace window keeps protecting an actively-scanned
  doc through a rename's transient entry-less gap instead of reaping it and forcing a full re-embed;
  (3) a doc whose embedding deterministically yields no vectors (an unembeddable body, a missing ONNX
  runtime) is now recorded as *attempted* and no longer re-extracted + re-embedded on every scan — a
  content-hash or embedding-preset change re-opens the attempt.

## [0.22.8] — 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **`basemind init` no longer writes a committed `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` unasked.** The rules
  block is a shared, version-controlled surface, so onboarding now defaults to the personal,
  gitignored sibling instead: `--rules-target auto` (the default) routes to ai-rulez when it owns
  governance, otherwise to `CLAUDE.local.md` (or `AGENTS.local.md` when the repo uses AGENTS) —
  never a committed file. The `/bm-init` slash command asks the user where the block should go, and
  the interactive CLI prompts for it; `--rules-target` gains `claude-local` / `agents-local`
  values, and `claude` / `agents` remain as the explicit opt-in to the committed files.

### Fixed

- **Comms daemon readiness flake (`spawned comms daemon did not become ready within the timeout`).**
  The Unix comms front-end peeked a freshly-accepted connection's first byte _inline in the accept
  loop_ (`peek_first_byte(&stream).await` before the spawn), so a single client that connected but
  was slow or silent to send its first byte parked the entire accept loop on `readable()`. Every
  other client then sat unaccepted in the kernel backlog — including `ensure_daemon`'s readiness
  probe, whose short timeout reported a perfectly healthy, still-running daemon as unreachable, which
  in turn spawned a replacement that hit `AddrInUse` and exited (`SpawnTimeout`). The peek + relay/
  legacy routing now runs *inside* the per-connection spawned task, so the accept loop only
  `accept()`s and `spawn`s and never awaits client I/O — a slow/silent client harms only its own
  task. This aligns the Unix path with the Windows named-pipe front-end, which already reads the
  first byte in-task. No blob/index schema change.

## [0.22.7] — 2026-07-25

### Changed

- **`basemind serve` is now a thin relay to the singleton daemon; the daemon hosts the MCP router.**
  Every client's `serve` used to open its own read-only store, build its own in-RAM code map, and
  lazily load its own ONNX + LanceDB (~300–370 MB RSS **per process**). On a `comms` build serving
  the working view, `serve` now dials the daemon, runs a tiny handshake, and pumps stdio bytes to it
  — the daemon hosts the rmcp router over **one shared read stack per workspace** (`SharedReadStack`),
  so the in-RAM map, ONNX model, LanceDB, and git caches are resident **once per workspace** instead
  of once per client. `ServerState` was split into a per-connection identity (`agent_id`,
  `comms_clients`, `log_level`) plus that shared stack, so distinct clients keep distinct memory-owner
  identities while sharing the heavy read state. Fallback is total: any handshake problem — no daemon,
  an older daemon (which rejects the `RELAY_MAGIC` preamble as an over-long frame), a proto/view
  mismatch, or `BASEMIND_MCP_LEAN` / a non-working view / `BASEMIND_SERVE_INPROCESS` — serves
  in-process exactly as before, so a client is never bricked. No blob/index schema change.
- **Daemon-hosted git-history now runs in-process** instead of the daemon dialing itself. A hosted
  connection's history reads and its startup sync route through a new in-process seam
  (`HistoryHost`, implemented by the daemon `Broker`) that shares the Broker's single open
  `git-history.fjall/` handle and per-repo build lock — so `recent_changes` / `commits_touching` /
  `blame_*` / `search_git_history` no longer pay a unix-socket round trip per call on the hosted
  path, while the single-holder + single-flight-build invariants are unchanged. A thin
  `daemon_writer` serve (the fallback) still forwards over the socket.
- **The `serve` relay now works on Windows named pipes.** Named pipes have no non-destructive peek
  (the Unix path uses `MSG_PEEK`), so the accept loop consumes the connection's first byte and
  replays it — to the relay handshake via a small `PrefixReader`, or to a legacy comms link via a
  seeded frame buffer — routing rmcp relay connections apart from comms links without a fallback to
  in-process serve.

### Fixed

- **Daemon-hosted precise `resolved_refs` (and `search_code`) no longer degrade.** Hosted connections
  read the daemon's read-write fjall index directly in-process via a host seam, so cross-file
  `find_callers` / `goto_definition` see the `refs_by_def` edges an index-less thin serve could not —
  without the daemon dialing itself over its own socket.

### Removed

- Deleted the orphaned `monitors/monitors.json` + `scripts/comms-monitor.sh` poll-loop scripts
  (referenced by no manifest; the daemon's `SubscribeInbox` push channel supersedes them).

## [0.22.6] — 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **The older-build daemon takeover now actually fires** (#44). `singleton::roundtrip` decoded a
  bare `CommsResponse`, but the daemon frames every reply as a `CommsOut::Response` envelope, so the
  decode always failed and `daemon_status` always returned `None`. `ensure_daemon` never entered its
  version gate and reused whatever daemon held the socket — so a live pre-0.22.5 runaway daemon
  survived the client upgrade instead of being reaped (it had to be killed by hand). The probe now
  decodes the `CommsOut` envelope; the 0.22.5 cache/GC remediation actually reaches machines with a
  lingering older daemon. Regression present since the takeover was introduced.

### Changed

- Refreshed the dependency lockfile (`auto_enums`, `derive_utils`). `cargo upgrade --incompatible`
  is a no-op: every incompatible upgrade is a deliberately pinned crate (`arrow-*` `=58`, `oxc_*`,
  `tree-sitter-python`).

## [0.22.5] — 2026-07-25

Hardening release after a starved-GC incident: a pre-0.22.4 daemon stuck in the #44 re-embed loop
held the blob-GC read lock indefinitely, which silently stopped **all** daemon maintenance and let
the machine-global cache grow to 116 GB with no signal anywhere. Updating also remediates lingering
pre-fix daemons: a 0.22.5 client stops any older-build daemon on first contact (existing
older-build takeover) instead of leaving it to run away.

### Added

- **Cache size budget with cold-workspace eviction.** `BASEMIND_CACHE_BUDGET_MB` (default 20 GiB;
  `0` = unlimited) bounds the machine-global cache. When workspaces + blobs exceed it, the GC
  sweep evicts the coldest workspace dirs (idle ≥ 24 h, never ones another process holds locked)
  and reclaims the blobs they pinned — the backstop the reference-counting GC lacked, since
  live-but-idle workspaces pin their blobs forever.
- **Persisted GC observability.** Every destructive sweep records its outcome (timestamp, blobs
  removed, bytes freed, workspaces reaped/evicted) to `gc-state.json` in the cache root, and
  `cache_stats` surfaces it as `last_gc` — a GC that stops running is now visible instead of a
  silent disk leak.

### Fixed

- **Blob GC runs at daemon startup and on its own task** (#44). It previously ran only as the
  last step of the hourly prune loop: a daemon restarting more often than hourly never swept once,
  and a single starved GC await stopped message pruning, thread archiving, and workspace eviction
  for the life of the process.
- **The GC's lock wait is bounded** (#44). Waiting for the blob-GC write lock now times out after
  5 minutes (logged, retried next cycle) instead of parking forever behind a runaway rescan's read
  guard — which, the lock being FIFO, also queued every subsequent rescan behind the stuck writer
  and wedged the daemon machine-wide.
- **A draining daemon refuses new rescans** (`rescan_draining`) instead of running doomed partial
  passes, and a rescan that queued behind a drain-cancelled pass fails fast instead of re-walking
  the tree — cancelled passes never advance the coalescing generation, so each one previously
  re-walked the whole monorepo.

### Changed

- Upgraded `gix` to 0.86 and `xberg` to 1.0.0-rc.37; `arrow-array`/`arrow-schema` are pinned to
  `=58` (required by LanceDB 0.31).

## [0.22.4] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **The daemon no longer loops full document re-embed passes on churny trees** (#44 — ~700 % CPU
  for hours, RSS to 5.4 GB on a multi-session pnpm monorepo). Root cause: `Store::write_doc` went
  through the schema-only skip in `write_blob`, so when the serve boot's Deferred pass had written
  a doc blob vectorless (`embedding_dim: 0`), the follow-up Inline pass re-extracted and re-embedded
  the document — and then silently threw the embedded result away. The blob stayed vectorless
  forever, and every entry-less encounter of the same content (NoCache rename remove+create pairs
  from #43, `git worktree` churn, fresh worktree-rooted workspaces) re-ran ONNX embedding from
  scratch. Doc blobs now overwrite on upgrade (the same fix the code-chunk tier already had), and
  `DocEntry` records embed state so already-poisoned caches heal with exactly one persisted
  re-embed pass on the next scan — no wipe needed. The same skip also meant `search_documents`
  vectors never landed in LanceDB, so document vector search now actually works for repo docs.
- **`basemind comms stop` and SIGTERM now interrupt a mid-scan daemon** (#44). The drain trips a
  cooperative per-file cancellation token threaded through the scanner, and the runtime teardown is
  bounded at 15 s instead of waiting forever on an in-flight rescan — previously only SIGKILL could
  end a scanning daemon, which fed the respawn loop. A cancelled pass commits completed files
  (including their LanceDB rows), never runs the stale purge, and surfaces as `rescan_cancelled`
  rather than a completed rescan.
- **Queued identical full rescans coalesce.** N sessions forwarding full rescans of the same
  workspace serialized on the store lock and each re-walked the whole tree; a request that waited
  behind an identical-or-stronger full scan is now served that scan's stats.
- Unreferenced blobs younger than 6 h survive the daemon's hourly GC sweep, protecting the
  Deferred→Inline and rename windows where content-addressed doc blobs are legitimately entry-less.

### Changed

- Dependencies: tree-sitter-language-pack 1.13.2 → 1.13.3, xberg rc.30 → rc.33, lockfile refresh
  (arrow stays on 58.x — lancedb 0.31 pins arrow 58).

### Added

- **`basemind agent` — a terminal coding agent over the code map.** A model-agnostic
  (bring-your-own-key) ratatui TUI that runs a turn-loop against basemind's in-process code-map and
  git tools. Launch it with `basemind agent [prompt]` (forwards `--continue` / `--resume` / the
  positional prompt); the `basemind-tui` binary now ships alongside `basemind` in every release
  archive, and `basemind agent` re-execs it.
- **Multi-agent room.** Agents sharing a repo can join a room over the comms broker: a roster of
  peers in the status area, `/post [subject:] <text>` to broadcast, `/roster` and `/leave` commands,
  incoming peer messages plus join/leave notices in the transcript, an unread cue, and model-facing
  `room:*` tools. The live broker room is built behind the `room` feature; its incoming stream
  reconnects with backoff, refreshes the roster on a cadence, and dedups by message id.

## [0.22.3] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **The file watcher no longer leaks memory or storms the CPU on large, churny trees.** On
  macOS/Windows the `notify-debouncer-full` debouncer defaulted to its `FileIdMap` cache, which
  recursively walks and `stat`s the entire watched subtree — following symlinks, at watch time and
  again on every directory create/rename — into an unbounded map. On a pnpm monorepo (a
  `node_modules` symlink farm plus in-repo git worktrees) that walk amplified without bound: RSS
  climbed 138 MB → 6.85 GB in ~3 minutes at 45–95 % CPU (#43, re-file of #41; CPU counterpart #33).
  Both the tree watcher (`basemind watch` / `serve`) and the internal view watcher now use
  `NoCache` — the same cache Linux already defaulted to — so the debouncer never walks the tree.
  basemind's own gitignore-aware `IndexFilter` still selects what a change rescans, and renames
  degrade to remove-old + create-new, which the incremental scanner already handles.

## [0.22.2] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Codex downstream workspaces now start the latest complete release reliably.** Codex resolved the
  old relative launcher inside its installed plugin cache, indexing the plugin instead of the user's
  workspace. Its plugin now locates a bundled bootstrap, resolves the latest published GitHub tag,
  and uses the serialized, checksummed launcher; simultaneous first starts cannot corrupt a shared
  `npx` cache.
- **MCP tools stay available across a release window.** The plugin launcher (`mcp-launch.sh`)
  hard-pinned to the plugin's exact version and aborted if that release's platform asset 404'd — so
  in the window between the plugin bumping to a new version and that release finishing its
  per-platform binary uploads, the session had no MCP server at all. On a missing pinned asset the
  launcher now re-execs pinned to the newest *published* GitHub release: GitHub exposes only
  finalized, non-draft releases at `/releases/latest`, and the publish workflow promotes a release
  only after every platform asset + checksums exist, so the fallback target is always complete and
  safe to run — even from an empty cache. A same-schema-minor cached binary remains the offline last
  resort. The launcher also now discovers the plugin manifest under any harness mirror
  (`.claude-plugin` / `.codex-plugin` / `.cursor-plugin`), so one launcher serves every coding agent.
- **The publish workflow heals partial releases and never publishes out of order.** A rerun that
  found any single release asset previously assumed the release was complete and skipped the build
  matrix, so a release missing a platform binary could never recover. It now requires the full
  archive + checksums set before treating a release as published, so a rerun rebuilds only the
  missing platforms. Publish concurrency keys on the resolved tag (a tag push and a manual dispatch
  for the same tag no longer race) and never cancels a publish mid-flight, and the crates.io publish
  waits for the release to finalize like the npm/PyPI publishes.
- **Version updates no longer leak basemind processes.** On update, the prior version's `serve` and
  comms daemon kept running beside the new generation, so the machine never converged on a single
  daemon. The launcher now terminates every basemind process (serve and comms/write/shell daemons —
  all the same binary) belonging to a different cached version before exec'ing the resolved binary,
  and prunes leftover install lock/staging dirs. Unix best-effort; never blocks or fails the launch.
  No API or on-disk-format change (blob/index schema unchanged).

## [0.22.1] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **basemind is publishable to crates.io again.** The 0.22.0 stack-graphs vendoring added four
  in-tree forks as versionless path dependencies with `publish = false`, which made `cargo publish`
  reject basemind ("all dependencies must have a version requirement specified"). The forks are
  renamed to owned, published crates — `basemind-stack-graphs`, `basemind-lsp-positions`,
  `basemind-tree-sitter-graph`, `basemind-tree-sitter-stack-graphs` — and referenced by version, so
  `cargo install basemind` works again. The publish workflow now releases the sub-crates in
  dependency order before basemind. No API or on-disk-format change (blob/index schema unchanged).

## [0.22.0] — 2026-07-20

> **Index rebuild on upgrade.** This release bumps the index/blob/comms schema (21 → 22), so every
> existing `.basemind/` (legacy, per-repo) and the new global cache wipe and rebuild from source on
> the next `basemind scan`. The cache location itself also moves: state no longer lives under a
> repo's `.basemind/` — it lives in a single global, content-addressed store under the XDG data
> directory (see below). This is the intended migration path; nothing you need to do beyond letting
> the next scan run.

### Added

- **Machine-wide daemon — concurrent sessions now read AND write.** A single background daemon per
  machine is the sole fjall writer for the index. Previously, one `serve` process per repo held the
  repo's fjall write-lock, so a second session on the same repo silently fell back to a read-only,
  increasingly stale view. `serve` now opens its store read-only (blobs only) and forwards writes
  (scan / rescan) to the daemon over a Unix domain socket (named pipe on Windows); the daemon starts
  on demand and is shared by every session on the machine. N sessions on one repo now all read and
  write without downgrade.
- **Global XDG cache + `BASEMIND_DATA_HOME`.** Index data (content-addressed blobs, per-workspace
  views, LanceDB) moves out of the repo and into `~/.local/share/basemind/` (overridable with
  `BASEMIND_DATA_HOME`), keyed by workspace. The blob store is now a single global, content-addressed
  cache that dedupes identical files across **every** repo and worktree on the machine, not just
  within one repo. `.basemind/` is no longer created in repos — the gitignore dance from `init` is
  gone.
- **Registry + worktree coordination tools.** The daemon keeps a cheap, always-on registry of
  repos, worktrees, and branches built from git plumbing, exposed as new MCP tools: `workspaces`
  (known repos on the machine), `worktrees` (linked worktrees for a repo), `branches` (branches per
  worktree), and `worktree_claim` / `worktree_release` — an advisory claim so multiple agent sessions
  don't collide working the same worktree at once.
- **`find_files`** — fuzzy, fzf/fd-style filename/path search across indexed files, ranked by match
  score. Complements the existing substring `list_files`.
- **`basemind statusline`** — a CLI subcommand that queries the daemon for the workspaces currently
  active and prints a compact status line; prints nothing (idle) when no daemon is running.
- **Thread comms replace room comms.** Agent coordination now uses threads instead of rooms: each
  thread is addressed by at least two of subject / path-glob / members, discovered by scope (member,
  cwd path-match, or subject filter — never global), with idle threads auto-archiving. See
  `thread_start` / `thread_post` / `thread_list` / `inbox_read` / `agent_list` in the MCP tool table.
- **Precise, scope- and import-aware name resolution for Python and Java** (feature
  `code-intel-stack`, included in `full` and the release binary). Until now only JavaScript/TypeScript
  resolved precisely (via oxc); every other language fell back to heuristic name matching, so
  `find_references` / `find_callers` / `goto_definition` could not tell a shadowed local from an
  import. basemind now runs GitHub stack-graphs-style `.tsg` name-binding rules — executed by an
  in-tree, tree-sitter-0.26 fork of the `tree-sitter-graph` / `tree-sitter-stack-graphs` engines
  (maintained under `crates/`) — to build a per-file scope/definition graph and resolve references to
  their true definitions. Delivers **intra-file** precision (shadowing, per-function/method parameter
  scope, Python comprehension bindings, Java field-vs-local) and **cross-file** resolution for Python:
  dotted and relative imports resolve to their target module, and each call site of an imported name
  resolves *through* the import to the exported definition (reporting `resolved: true`), rather than
  matching by name. No new MCP tools or query surface — existing navigation just gets precise for
  these languages. Known limitations this iteration: Java cross-file resolution of *member* calls on
  an imported type (`Foo.greet()`) is not yet resolved (the imported type itself is), and a variable
  reused after a same-name Python comprehension may bind to the comprehension's own variable.
- **`[code_intel] precise_resolution` config toggle** (default `true`). Set it to `false` in
  `basemind.toml` to skip the precise engines (oxc + stack-graphs) and fall back to fast tree-sitter
  `locals` scope binding for every language. Applies to files (re)scanned after the change.
- **`[resources]` governance config.** A new table bounds basemind's memory and CPU footprint for
  fitting a large workspace on a modest host: `embed_threads` (caps the ONNX embedding pool;
  supersedes the deprecated `[documents].embed_max_threads` alias), `embed_batch_size` (default 32),
  `scan_threads` (caps the scanner rayon pool), `document_models` (`full` | `code_only` | `none` —
  narrows the document tier for a code-centric workspace), and `max_footprint_mb`, enforced by a
  best-effort backpressure gate that samples the process `phys_footprint` (mach `TASK_VM_INFO`, which
  counts compressed and swapped-out pages) at the document-extraction and embedding admit points and
  parks over-ceiling workers on a bounded backoff — never failing a scan. The schema change is
  additive (no `RELEASE_MINOR`/blob bump).
- **`inbox_wait`** — a blocking comms tool that returns the moment a peer posts to a joined thread (or
  on timeout), replacing the `inbox_read`/`thread_list` polling loop. Backed by the broker's existing
  push fan-out via a membership-routed `SubscribeInbox` sink over an ephemeral connection, so a long
  wait can't head-of-line-block other comms calls.
- **Per-call latency in every tool response.** Latency-relevant tools now return `elapsed_us` (tool
  body only — index/store lookups, git walks, ranking, response construction; excludes transport and
  serialization) and the CLI additionally reports `startup_us`, so query cost is observable and
  distinct from process startup. Microseconds because the warm code-map path is routinely
  sub-millisecond.

### Changed

- **Cache moved out of the repo.** Everything the scanner and index used to write under a repo's
  `.basemind/` now lives under the global XDG cache, keyed by workspace — a repo checkout no longer
  gains any basemind-owned files or directories.
- **Blobs are global and deduped across repos.** The content-addressed blob store used to be
  per-repo; it is now one machine-wide store, so identical file content scanned from different repos
  or worktrees is extracted and stored once.
- **`find_callers` reports a complete result; precision is now additive.** The name scan (the same
  sound scan `find_references` runs) is the floor and defines `total`/`hits`; import resolution can
  only refine it, surfacing precision as a per-hit `resolved` flag plus a `resolved_total` lower
  bound. Previously resolution ran first and returned early, so a partial resolution could report a
  confident, complete-looking, wrong subset (see Fixed).
- **1000-line module cap is now enforced.** `tests/max_lines.rs` walks `src/**/*.rs` and fails
  `cargo test` on any file over the cap — the documented `rust-max-lines` poly check never actually
  existed (poly's custom rules are ast-grep matches and cannot count lines). Several files that had
  drifted past the cap were split along real seams into sibling modules, behaviour-preserving by
  construction (the `keys.rs` split keeps `symbol_kind_byte`'s persisted `u8` ordinals byte-identical).
- **Dependency upgrades.** xberg `1.0.0-rc.30`, crawlberg `1.0.7`, tree-sitter-language-pack `1.13.1`,
  and the latest compatible versions across the tree; `arrow-array`/`arrow-schema` held at 58 in
  lock-step with lancedb 0.31. stack-graphs is vendored under `crates/` with two upstream panics
  fixed.

### Removed

- **Per-repo `.basemind/` writes.** basemind no longer creates or gitignores a `.basemind/` directory
  inside a repo; `basemind init` no longer adds it to `.gitignore`.
- **Room comms API.** `room_list` / `room_join` / `room_leave` / `room_post` / `room_history` and the
  CLI `basemind comms rooms` / `join` / `leave` / `room-create` / `post` / `history` surface are
  replaced by thread comms (see Added above).

### Fixed

- **`basemind init` no longer scaffolds into a parent directory.** `init` resolved its target with
  the same ancestor-`.basemind/` walk the other commands use to *attach* to an existing index, so
  running it inside a repo whose parent already had a `.basemind/` wrote `basemind.toml`, `.gitignore`,
  and the rules block into the parent instead of the current repo. `init` now anchors to the closest
  enclosing git repository (falling back to the working directory when not in a repo), so it always
  scaffolds the project you run it in.
- **Root discovery no longer climbs across a nested subrepo boundary.** `discover_root_with_basemind`
  walked up looking for an ancestor `.basemind/` without a ceiling, so running from inside a nested
  git subrepo (checked out under a polyrepo that has its own root `.basemind/`) wrongly attached to
  the parent polyrepo's index. The upward walk is now bounded by the closest enclosing git repository
  — the subrepo's own root is the ceiling. A non-git monorepo (no git boundary anywhere) still walks
  freely to an ancestor `.basemind/`.
- Fixed Codex plugin MCP startup by using the required root `.mcp.json` shape and resolving the
  launcher relative to the installed plugin instead of an unsupported `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholder.
- **`find_callers` reported 2 callers where there were 172.** It ran import resolution first and
  returned early on any hit, so the name scan ran only as a fallback when resolution found nothing.
  When resolution saw 2 of 172 real call sites it reported `total: 2` with no truncation flag — a
  confident, complete-looking, wrong answer an agent would act on. The name scan is now the floor and
  resolution only annotates it (a Python case that returned 7 of ~4,000 now returns the full set).
- **`workspace_grep` returned a fast, confident, wrong zero.** `scan_cap` bounded *files visited*, so
  a default grep over a 68k-file workspace searched ~2.9% of it in arbitrary path order and stopped —
  and a rare identifier, which is precisely what one greps for, does not live in the first 2.9%.
  `limit` now caps *hits*, the whole corpus is scanned (rayon-parallel with a memmem literal
  prefilter), and `total_matches`/`total_files_matched` are exact. A latent cursor bug that dropped a
  file's remaining matches on a mid-file `limit` boundary is fixed by packing `(candidate, hit
  ordinal)` into the cursor.
- **The git-history index was built and read from nowhere on a `--features full` binary.** Fjall's
  directory lock is exclusive even for a read-only open, so serve (which opens read-only under
  `comms`) could not hold the history DB; the handle was `None`, serve never built the index, and
  every git tool silently live-walked forever. The daemon now owns both the build and the reads
  (`GitHistoryIndex` is a `Local | Remote` backend enum), the per-repo build is serialized so N
  sessions cause one walk, and the one-shot CLI routes its history reads through the daemon instead of
  climbing a retry ladder and live-walking. Measured, daemon up: CLI startup ~1.56 s → ~5 ms, a git
  query ~1.59 s → ~10 ms.
- **`search_documents` could never see anything the web lane ingested.** The scanner writes documents
  under the repo scope while `web_scrape`/`web_crawl` write under `web:<host>`, and the search
  hard-filtered on the repo scope with no way to name the other namespace — so every scraped page was
  written, embedded, and then permanently invisible. `scope` is now a search parameter (defaulting to
  the repo scope), and the ingest tools echo the scope they wrote under, so the pair composes.
- **A daemon `--features full` build embedded nothing it scanned.** The forwarded initial scan ran a
  `Deferred` (code map + BM25 keyword) pass only; the vector-fill follow-up the non-daemon path spawns
  was never forwarded, so LanceDB stayed empty for every repository document and code chunk
  (`web_scrape` worked because it embeds inline). The daemon can now run an `Inline` embed pass, and
  `serve` forwards a detached vector-fill follow-up after the fast initial scan — off the boot
  handshake, so startup never blocks on ONNX. Live watcher rescans and the `rescan` tool forward it
  too.
- **A failure in an optional lane destroyed the code map.** The scanner flushed the code map *after*
  the optional lanes (embeddings, documents, code-intel), so any lane that failed took the whole map
  with it — leaving gigabytes of blobs behind a `file_count` of 0 and a full re-scan on every launch.
  The map is now persisted before the optional lanes run, each lane runs under `catch_unwind`, and a
  per-file panic in the resolve pass costs only that file's edges.
- **The machine daemon's footprint climbed to ~13 GB at monorepo scale and never released.** The
  `Inline` embed pass accumulated every file's embedding rows (a 768-dim vector + chunk text per
  chunk) for the whole corpus in RAM before one LanceDB write. It now streams per file, so peak embed
  RAM is one file independent of corpus size (a `phys_footprint`-ratchet regression test pins it flat
  across passes). A related serve-side RSS sawtooth — a whole-map rebuild on every no-op rescan — is
  gone: an `(path, content-hash)` fingerprint proves the blobs are byte-identical and the resident map
  is reused.
- **A panicking request handler pinned its daemon forever.** The idle reaper counts live links, and
  the refcount was released by a plain statement after the accept loop, which an unwind walks past —
  so one panicking handler left the count above zero and that daemon never reaped, stacking an
  immortal process on every run. The refcount is now an RAII `LinkGuard` released by `Drop` (also
  closing the accept/exit race), and idle detection consults in-flight work, not link count alone.
- **Every CLI invocation rebuilt the whole in-RAM map cache** — ~3–5 s flat, up to 11 s under load,
  even for `repo-info`, which never reads the map. The one-shot CLI now builds it lazily at the cache
  barrier, only for tools that scan the corpus (`repo-info` ~534 µs vs `search_symbols` ~1 s). En
  route this fixed `complete()` reading the map without taking the barrier every other cache-reading
  tool takes — an intermittent flake that would have become a permanent empty under lazy-cache.
- **Orphaned workspace caches pinned blobs forever.** Nothing reaped the per-workspace cache dir of a
  deleted repo, so the global blob store could only grow (48 workspace dirs for 2 live repos). A
  marker-based reaper now records the canonical root and reclaims dead workspaces before the blob
  sweep — conservatively keeping anything it can't prove dead (held lock, or a root whose parent is
  also missing, e.g. an unmounted volume).
- **Two agents sharing one identity shared one inbox.** The CLI's persisted-id tier read the
  pre-0.22 in-repo path that no longer exists, so every CLI call collapsed onto a shared
  `"basemind-cli"` constant (and `serve` onto `"anon"`). All four resolvers are consolidated to a
  single chain — env, config, then a generated id persisted in the correct per-workspace cache dir,
  then a process-unique id — never a shared constant, and honouring `comms.agent_id`.
- **A thread scoped to `<dir>/**` was invisible to an agent whose cwd *is* `<dir>`.** globset's `**`
  requires a component after the slash, so the recursive form never matched its own base — the most
  common cwd. The stripped base is retried, covering the root without widening the glob.
- **Cross-file `goto_definition` silently dropped every tsconfig-aliased import.** oxc resolves a
  tsconfig `paths` alias against a *canonicalized* `baseUrl`, so on a symlinked root the resolved
  target's prefix didn't match and the cross-file edge was discarded. The resolver now discovers the
  governing tsconfig per importing file (what `tsc` applies) and `to_repo_relative` retries against
  the canonical root — a no-op on non-symlinked roots.
- **A daemon-writer rescan didn't invalidate in-flight `search_symbols` cursors on unchanged
  content.** The `cache_generation` bump was nested inside the map rebuild, which the fingerprint
  optimization skips on a no-op rescan, so a stale cursor read as valid — contradicting the documented
  `invalidated on rescan` contract. The bump is now unconditional.
- **Telemetry recorded call latency in milliseconds, so every sub-millisecond tool read as `0`.** The
  sink now stamps microseconds (legacy `elapsed_ms` rows are rescaled on read), matching the
  response-level `elapsed_us` reading.
- **Fjall ran on its 32 MiB default block cache against a multi-GB index.** The cache is now sized at
  20% of the on-disk index, clamped to [32 MiB, 256 MiB] (`BASEMIND_INDEX_CACHE_BYTES` overrides);
  `find_references("get")` on django went 907 µs → 285 µs for +15.9 MB RSS.
- **`web_crawl` followed links off the seed host.** crawlberg's `stay_on_domain` defaults off and the
  engine builder never set it, so a crawl wandered onto every domain it linked to. On-host scope is
  forced now (subdomains still excluded).
- **`web_map` returned every URL a site has, uncapped** — 482k URLs on docs.rs drove peak RSS into the
  multi-GB range and OOM-killed the process. `limit` (default 100, max 1000) now caps the response,
  and crawlberg 1.0.7's `map_limit` bounds the sitemap fetch itself, holding peak to roughly the cap
  plus one child sitemap; `total_urls` becomes a floor with `truncated` set.
- **`cache_stats` no longer flakes when a `*.tmp` file vanishes mid size-walk**, and an fsevents
  watcher test race (an event landing before stream registration is lost forever) is closed by
  re-writing until the watcher reports the path.

## [0.21.1] — 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **Extracted the Hermes Agent plugin into a standalone `basemind-hermes-plugin` PyPI package.** The
  helper skills, slash commands, `plugin.yaml`, and the `hermes_agent.plugins` entry point now live in
  the pure-Python `pip-package-hermes/` (import package `basemind_hermes_plugin`), which ships no
  binary and shells out to the `basemind` on `PATH`. The `basemind` pip package is now a pure
  binary-wrapper (no plugin, no entry point). Install the binary via Homebrew/npm/cargo/release and
  `pip install basemind-hermes-plugin` for the plugin, then `hermes plugins enable basemind`. The
  entry-point name stays `basemind`, so the enable command is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Binary download no longer crashes when `/tmp` and `$HOME` are on different filesystems (#38).**
  `ensure_binary` staged the extracted binary in the system temp dir and then atomically renamed it
  into `~/.cache/basemind`, which raised `OSError: [Errno 18] Invalid cross-device link` on hosts
  where those are separate mounts. Staging now happens under the cache root so the rename stays on one
  device.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `xberg` to `1.0.0-rc.21` and ran `cargo upgrade --incompatible`: `crawlberg` 1.0.5,
  `jsonschema` 0.47, `rmcp` 2.2, `regex` 1.13, `lru` 0.18.1, `tree-sitter-language-pack` 1.12.5.
  `arrow-array`/`arrow-schema` held at 58 to stay in lockstep with `lancedb` 0.31's transitive Arrow.
  Blob + index format unchanged (patch release).

## [0.21.0] — 2026-07-10

Minor bump: `RELEASE_MINOR` advances 20 → 21, so the `.basemind/` index + blob cache is wiped and
rebuilt from source on the next `basemind scan` (expected — the msgpack blob store is content-
addressed and rebuilds losslessly).

### Added

- **`basemind init` onboarding + `/bm-init` slash command.** A re-runnable setup flow that scaffolds
  the root `basemind.toml`, gitignores `.basemind/`, and injects an idempotent, clearly-delimited
  rules block into the repo's agent guidance (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, or an `.ai-rulez` rule file
  when that's the source of truth) teaching agents to prefer basemind over grep/read/git per
  capability. Interactive by default; `--yes` plus `--with`/`--without`, `--rules-target`,
  `--no-rules`, and `--print` (dry-run) drive it non-interactively. The block is spliced between
  stable `<!-- BEGIN/END basemind -->` markers so re-running never duplicates it and never touches
  content outside the markers.
- **Monorepo-aware root resolution.** basemind now walks up from the working directory to the nearest
  ancestor containing `.basemind/` (the way git finds `.git/`), so running an agent from a subfolder
  of a monorepo attaches to the root index instead of finding nothing. `.basemind` discovery takes
  precedence over git-root discovery; `--root` still overrides.
- **Index lifecycle signalling on MCP responses + `status`.** Read tools attach a `notice`
  (`warming_up` / `building_index` / `rescanning`) with an actionable retry hint so an agent never
  mistakes a mid-warmup or mid-scan result for "no matches". `status` gains `warming` + `warm_ms`.

### Fixed

- **`serve` answers the MCP handshake before warming the code map.** The in-RAM preload (a rayon
  `par_iter` over every L1/L2 blob) ran synchronously before `.serve(transport)`, so on a loaded
  machine — several sessions' scans saturating the shared rayon pool — it could queue for minutes,
  blow the client's plugin-MCP startup window, and the tools would never register. The preload now
  runs in a background task; `initialize`/`tools/list` answer immediately regardless of tree size or
  contention. Cache-reading tools await a bounded (15s) ready signal so a query issued during warmup
  still returns complete data rather than an empty snapshot. `diff_outline`, `blame_symbol`,
  `memory_audit`, and `proposal_accept` — which read the map directly — now await warm too, closing a
  window where they returned a wrong diff, a spurious "not indexed" error, or a false stale verdict.
- **`basemind init` refuses to splice into a file with malformed markers.** A stray or unpaired
  `BEGIN`/`END` marker (a hand-edit or bad merge) could make a re-run replace everything between an
  orphaned marker and an unrelated pair, silently deleting the user's own content. init now bails on
  any malformed marker state instead of guessing, and absorbs a CRLF trailing newline so a
  Windows-line-ending rules file converges to a byte-stable fixpoint (no phantom `--print` diff).

## [0.20.0] — 2026-07-08

Minor bump: `RELEASE_MINOR` advances 19 → 20, so the `.basemind/` index + blob cache is wiped and
rebuilt from source on the next `basemind scan` (expected — the msgpack blob store is content-
addressed and rebuilds losslessly).

### Added

- **Root config at `<root>/basemind.toml` (committable).** Config moved out of the wipe-on-schema-bump
  `.basemind/` cache to the repo root so it survives cache wipes and can be committed. The legacy
  `.basemind/basemind.toml` is still read as a fallback; the root file wins when both exist.
  `basemind init` now scaffolds a fully-documented root config (every value is the built-in default)
  and adds `.basemind/` to `.gitignore`. It refuses to overwrite an existing config and refuses to
  shadow a legacy in-cache config rather than silently stranding your settings.
- **`scan.follow_symlinks`** (default `false`). Symlinks often escape the repo (e.g. Bazel's
  `bazel-*` convenience symlinks); the walker no longer follows them unless you opt in. `extra_roots`
  always follow symlinks regardless.
- **`embed_exclude` glob lists on `code_search` and `documents`.** Keep a file chunked + keyword-
  indexed while skipping its embedding — useful for large generated or vendored files.
- **`documents.extract_archives`** (default `false`). Opt into xberg's recursive archive extractor
  for `.zip/.tar/.jar/…`; off by default so one archive can't explode into thousands of embeds. True
  binaries (`.so/.wasm/.exe/…`) are always rejected regardless of this flag.

### Changed

- **Code embeddings are now OFF by default (`code_search.embed = false`).** A general-English model
  embeds *code* weakly, and the BM25 keyword lane already serves the NL→symbol query over the same
  text, so code embedding isn't worth the ONNX download + ORT pass + vector store. Code is still
  chunked and keyword-indexed; documents and images still embed. Existing code-search users who rely
  on vector search over code must set `code_search.embed = true` to keep it.
- **Always-on exclude floor.** A hard floor of near-universal build-artifact / dependency-cache / VCS
  / editor directories (`node_modules`, `target`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`,
  `.pytest_cache`, `bazel-*`, `.git`, `.basemind`, `.idea`, `.DS_Store`, …) is applied on top of
  `scan.exclude` — narrowing the user list can add to it but never drops a floor entry.

### Fixed

- **Worktrees reuse the shared cache instead of redoing work.** Scanning a fresh git worktree no
  longer re-parses files whose extraction already lives in the shared (main-worktree) blob store —
  the scanner deserializes the cached L1/L2 frame instead of re-running tree-sitter. The git-history
  index is likewise shared: it is derived entirely from the shared `.git` object database, so a
  linked worktree resolves it to the main worktree's `.basemind` (mirroring the blob store) rather
  than rebuilding its own. On a large monorepo a cold worktree scan drops from ~181s to ~25s (~7×)
  with ~2.6× less peak memory. The scan summary gains a `reused` counter reporting cache hits.
- **Re-embed on same-dim preset model swaps.** The per-file embedding cache keyed on vector dimension
  only, but `balanced` and `multilingual` both produce 768-dim vectors — so switching between them
  reused the old model's cached vectors. Cache reuse now also requires the embedding model/preset to
  match (both the code and document tiers), so a preset change cleanly drops the old vectors and
  re-embeds. `CodeChunkBlob` gains a blob-compatible `embedding_model` field (no schema bump).
- **Hugging Face model downloads no longer hang forever behind a firewall.** Bumped xberg to
  `1.0.0-rc.16`, which adds connect/read timeouts to the HF model fetch so a blocked or silently
  dropped connection (corporate firewall, offline host) fails fast instead of stalling the embedding
  / OCR / NER model download indefinitely.

## [0.19.2] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) prebuilt binary.** macOS is no longer Apple-Silicon-only —
  the release now ships a native Intel binary with full feature parity. `ort` has no static
  x86_64-apple-darwin ONNX Runtime (Microsoft dropped `onnxruntime-osx-x86_64` after 1.23), so the
  Intel leg builds `--features full,ort-dynamic` (`ort/load-dynamic`) and `package-release.sh`
  vendors `libonnxruntime.dylib` + its closure next to the binary with `@loader_path` install-names;
  ort resolves it relative to the executable, so ONNX loads with zero end-user setup. `brew install`
  now works on Intel Macs too. The release completeness gate expects five archives.

### Fixed

- **Apple Silicon under a Rosetta x86_64 shell now installs.** Rosetta masks `hw.optional.arm64`, so
  the previous probe fell through to the Intel branch and aborted with "Intel macOS not supported" —
  even though the machine is Apple Silicon. All three installers (shell launcher, npm `install.js`,
  pip `downloader.py`) now also probe `sysctl.proc_translated` (set only under Rosetta, which exists
  only on Apple Silicon) and hand such shells the native arm64 binary. A genuine Intel Mac gets the
  new x86_64 binary.
- **`/bm-statusline` now selects the correct (highest) version.** The persisted resolver ranked
  cached `statusline.sh` copies by mtime (`ls -dt`), so an older version dir touched more recently
  won — showing a stale bar. It now resolves the marketplace clone first, else the highest-versioned
  cache copy via `sort -V`, and never renders blank (a one-line hint replaces an empty bar).

### Changed

- **Installers prune stale cached binaries.** The launcher and pip downloader accrued a directory per
  release under `~/.cache/basemind/(bin/)<version>` (users saw six). Each now removes old per-version
  dirs once the current version is confirmed present, so only the running version is kept.
- **Dependencies refreshed** to latest (`cargo upgrade --incompatible`): `xberg` → `1.0.0-rc.11`,
  `fjall` → `3.1.6`, plus transitive lockfile updates. `arrow-array`/`arrow-schema` are intentionally
  held at `58` until lancedb's transitive arrow moves (they must stay in lockstep).

## [0.19.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **`scan.extra_roots` now works on Windows.** Files outside the repo root are keyed by their
  absolute path; the Windows drive-prefixed form (`C:/…`) is now recognized on the consuming side —
  previously only POSIX `/…` keys resolved, so external files were unqueryable there. Unix keys are
  unchanged (index format untouched).

### Security

- Bump `crossbeam-epoch` to 0.9.20 for RUSTSEC-2026-0204 (invalid pointer dereference in the
  `fmt::Pointer` impl for `Atomic`/`Shared`), pulled transitively via rayon.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-07

> Minor release — the index + blob schema version bumps (`RELEASE_MINOR` 18 → 19), so `.basemind/`
> is wiped and rebuilt on the next scan.

### Added

- **Hermes Agent plugin.** basemind now integrates with [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com):
  `pip install basemind` exposes a Hermes plugin (discovered via the `hermes_agent.plugins` entry
  point) that bundles the helper skills, slash commands, and agent-comms notifications. Tools are
  wired through Hermes's MCP config (`mcp_servers.basemind` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`) — a Hermes
  plugin cannot declare an MCP server. See the README "Hermes" install section. Closes #36.

### Changed

- **Claude status line survives version bumps.** `/bm-statusline` now writes a version-independent
  resolver as the `statusLine` command (re-resolving the newest installed `statusline.sh` at each
  render) instead of a version-pinned path that broke on update. The bar also shows the running
  basemind version (`v<version>`, full/compact tiers; opt out with `BASEMIND_STATUSLINE_VERSION=0`).

### Performance

Wide hot-path allocation + algorithmic sweep across the scanner, extraction, git, and MCP query
paths. All changes are internal — no behavior, response-shape, or on-disk-format change, and the
determinism assertions are unchanged.

- **`call_graph`** (`bfs_callees`) precomputes a name→sites map once instead of re-scanning every
  indexed symbol for each discovered callee — O(max_nodes × symbols) → O(symbols + max_nodes).
- **`architecture_map`**: `callee_counts` no longer allocates a `String` on every one of up to 4M
  scanned call sites (allocates only on first sight of a name); the symbol-tier fan-out set skips the
  allocation for duplicate callees; PageRank reuses a single accumulator buffer (20 allocations → 1).
  Output stays byte-identical.
- **Tree-sitter `QueryCursor`** is now pooled per thread alongside the parser pool — ~3 fewer
  allocations per scanned file.
- **git**: `diff_file` no longer clones the (potentially multi-MB) file buffers just to record
  existence; the `blame` / `log` / `commit-files` disk-cache writers serialize from borrowed slices
  instead of cloning the whole payload; `dependents` drops a `RelPath`↔`PathBuf` round-trip over the
  entire file index.
- **document tier**: `build_doc_rows` moves per-chunk text + embedding vectors instead of cloning
  them; the archive-extension check is an `AHashSet` (O(1)) instead of a 40-element linear scan.
- **paths**: the scanner (`scan_paths`) and watcher skip a `\`→`/` `String` allocation on Unix.
- **BM25 index**: the posting value drops a `.to_vec()` (`lsm_tree::Slice: From<[u8; N]>`) and the
  forward-map value is built in one sized allocation instead of an alloc-plus-realloc.

### Internal

- `for_each_call_in_file` (the dual-backend Fjall / in-RAM call-site scan) now lives once in
  `mcp/helpers_calls.rs`, shared by `architecture_map` and the call-graph helpers; `capture_name` is
  deduplicated into `extract/mod.rs`. Removed a dead `last_emitted_key` in `find_implementations`.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-07-06

> **Patch release — blob + index format unchanged.** `RELEASE_MINOR` stays 18; no `.basemind/`
> rebuild. Query-side only.

### Changed

- **`architecture_map` symbol tier now ranks by specificity-weighted fan-in.** The repo-wide
  symbol tier previously ranked by raw name-based call count, so ubiquitous names (`new`, `from`,
  `default`) dominated — on a real repo the top ~60 hubs were all `new`, which misleads an agent
  routing on the result. Fan-in is now divided by the number of files defining that name
  (`RepoGraph::def_counts`), so a genuine single-definition hub outranks a name that is merely
  everywhere. The raw `fan_in` count is still reported verbatim on each node.

### Fixed

- **`architecture_map` symbol-tier `score` is now monotonic with node order.** `fan_out` was
  computed *after* the knee-cut, so the blended `score` never actually influenced selection or
  ordering and the emitted nodes were not sorted by their own `score`. Selection, knee-cut, and
  `score` now all key off the single specificity-weighted signal, matching the module/file tiers;
  `fan_out` and per-file churn remain reported but no longer pretend to affect the ranking.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-07-06

> **Minor release — cache rebuild.** `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps to 18, so both the Fjall index and the
> content-addressed blob store are wiped and rebuilt from source on the next `basemind scan` (the
> standard minor-release migration). No config or on-wire tool-response change.

### Added

- **`architecture_map` MCP tool — deterministic, LLM-free architecture overview.** Ranks modules
  and symbols by graph centrality + churn and surfaces circular-dependency clusters, all derived
  from real call edges (never hallucinated). A whole-repo adjacency graph is built in memory at
  query time from the cached call sites (Fjall `calls_by_path`, or the in-RAM call cache in
  read-only multi-session mode) — no new Fjall partition, no blob I/O. Metrics are cheap and
  deterministic: fan-in/fan-out degree, fixed-iteration PageRank (damping 0.85, 20 iterations,
  id-ordered accumulation — call-twice byte-identical), and iterative Tarjan SCC for cycle
  clusters. Three tiers via `granularity`: `module` (default; files collapsed to a directory
  prefix at `depth`), `file` (the base graph), and `symbol` (function→function drill-down under a
  `focus`). Results are ranked, Kneedle knee-cut, then bounded by the shared `apply_budget` token
  budgeter; edges are emitted only between surviving nodes. Optional `include_churn` overlay
  reuses the `hot_files` aggregation. Node/edge caps set `truncated` + `truncation_reason` on
  overflow. CLI: `query architecture-map`. New internal `kneedle` knee-detection helper
  (Satopaa 2011, dependency-free).

## [0.17.0] — 2026-07-05

> **Minor release — cache rebuild.** `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps to 17, so both the Fjall index and the
> content-addressed blob store are wiped and rebuilt from source on the next `basemind scan` (the
> standard minor-release migration). No config or on-wire tool-response change.

### Added

- **Semantic code search (Phase 1, vector-only).** New `search_code` MCP tool runs vector KNN over
  source-code chunks and `get_chunk` fetches a chunk's body — the same two-call pointer pattern as
  `search_symbols` → `expand`. Chunks are derived from the cached L1/L2 extraction + source bytes
  (no re-parse): one chunk per symbol span plus module-level gap chunks, oversized spans split with
  overlap. A content-addressed `<hash>.chunk.msgpack` sidecar caches chunks + embeddings so an
  unchanged file skips re-embedding. Vectors land in a new LanceDB `code_chunks` table alongside the
  documents/memory tables (shared embedding preset). CLI: `query search-code` / `query get-chunk`.
  Behind the `code-search` cargo feature (folded into `full`); BM25 keyword + RRF hybrid fusion land
  in later phases. The `code_chunks` table is created lazily on open, so it rides the existing
  minor-release `.basemind/` rebuild — no separate schema bump.
- **Keyword code search (Phase 2, native BM25).** `search_code` gains a `mode` parameter:
  `semantic` (the default vector lane) or `keyword`, a native Okapi BM25 (`k1 = 1.2`, `b = 0.75`)
  lane over each chunk's symbol + signature + doc + body text. Postings live in two new Fjall
  keyspaces (`code_bm25_postings` inverted + `code_bm25_by_path` forward for O(prefix) re-scan
  deletes); term frequency and document length are inlined so scoring a term is a single prefix
  scan, and corpus stats (`N`, `avgdl`) are recomputed once per scan. The keyword lane reads only
  Fjall and the chunk sidecar — no LanceDB and no embedder — so it works even with
  `[code_search] embed = false`. RRF fusion of the two lanes plus an exact symbol lane lands in
  Phase 3.
- **Hybrid code search (Phase 3, RRF fusion + exact lane + rerank).** `search_code` gains a third
  `mode`, `hybrid` — now the **default** — that fuses three lanes via Reciprocal Rank Fusion: the
  vector (semantic) lane, the BM25 keyword lane, and a new **exact symbol lane** that resolves an
  identifier-shaped query against the `symbols_by_name` index to the chunks defining that symbol
  (the scope-aware signal a pure vector+keyword stack can't produce). Fusion joins the lanes on
  `chunk_id` and is score-scale-agnostic, so it blends an L2 distance, a BM25 score, and a symbol
  match order without normalization; it degrades gracefully, dropping any lane that is unavailable
  (e.g. the vector lane without embeddings). An optional cross-encoder **rerank** pass (`rerank:true`
  / `[code_search.reranker]`, off by default) reuses the same xberg reranker as the documents tier.
  No index-schema change — reuses the existing keyspaces and the `code_chunks` table.
- **`search_code` why-matched provenance.** Hybrid hits now carry per-lane provenance:
  `matched_lanes` (which of `exact` / `vector` / `keyword` produced the hit, in fixed lane order)
  plus the 1-based `exact_rank` / `vector_rank` / `keyword_rank` the chunk held in each contributing
  lane. Lets an agent tell an exact-symbol match from a semantic neighbor or a cross-lane agreement
  without a second call. Additive, non-breaking response fields (absent outside hybrid mode).
- **`status` reports boot-scan indexing state.** When `serve` auto-scans an empty index on startup,
  that build cost was invisible and could fold into the first query's latency. `status` now carries
  `indexing: true` while the boot scan runs and `index_build_ms` once it completes — so a client can
  tell "index not ready yet, poll again" from "no matches", separating index-build time from query
  time. Additive fields, absent on the common ready path.
- **Code-intelligence tier: scope- and import-resolved navigation.** A post-scan resolve pass links
  each reference to its actual definition — scope-aware, not a name match. Intra-file resolution runs
  across 80+ languages via tree-sitter `locals` (with vendored queries for Python / TypeScript / TSX
  / Go); JS/TS additionally get cross-file resolution via oxc scope analysis + `oxc_resolver` import
  stitching. New `goto_definition` MCP tool + `query goto-definition` CLI resolve a `path:line:column`
  to its definition, following cross-file import bindings. Behind the `code-intel-js` feature (folded
  into `full`) for the JS/TS engine; the `locals` tier is always on.
- **Document tier reuses the content-addressed cache instead of re-embedding every scan.** The
  documents pipeline now tracks each file in a new `Index.doc_files` map and, before extracting,
  reads back the cached `<hash>.doc.msgpack` blob (which already carries chunks + embeddings): an
  unchanged doc is skipped, and byte-identical content at any other path — or, with the shared cache
  below, any other worktree — reuses the extraction instead of re-running xberg + ONNX. Removed docs
  now have their LanceDB rows and tracking entry pruned. `doc_files` is `#[serde(default)]` — additive,
  no schema bump.
- **Shared blob cache across git worktrees.** Linked worktrees now resolve their content-addressed
  blob directory to the main worktree's `.basemind/blobs` (via gix `common_dir`), so a file's
  extraction + embedding is computed once and shared across every worktree of the clone; views +
  LanceDB stay per-worktree. Auto-GC is disabled while a shared cache exists (a single-worktree sweep
  could reap a sibling's blobs).
- **Bounded embedding threads.** All ONNX embedding now runs on a dedicated rayon pool capped at
  `documents.embed_max_threads` (default `0` = auto `max(2, cores/4)`), and xberg's internal fan-out
  is capped to match. Code-map extraction keeps the full pool; embedding can no longer pin every core
  or balloon RSS on a large monorepo.
- **New config:** `documents.max_chunks_per_document` (default 2000) caps vector rows per document;
  `documents.extension_denylist` extends the built-in archive/binary skip list; `documents.embed_max_threads`
  bounds the embedding pool. `[scan] exclude` gains Bazel defaults (`bazel-out/`, `bazel-bin/`,
  `bazel-testlogs/`, `bazel-*/`), and a large-candidate-count scan logs a warning.
- **mtime+size fast-path on rescan.** An unchanged working-tree file is now confirmed with a single
  `stat()` (size + nanosecond mtime match + sidecars present) instead of a full read + blake3 hash —
  the bulk of the per-file cost on a large-monorepo warm rescan. mtime moved to nanosecond resolution
  so the fast-path is effectively race-free; it's an internal comparison value, so no schema bump.

### Changed

- **Serve boot defers embedding to a background pass.** On `serve` auto-scan of an empty index, the
  first pass now runs in a new `EmbedMode::Deferred` mode: it writes the code-map, the BM25 keyword
  lane, and the content-addressed blobs but **skips** the ONNX embedding, so `outline` /
  `search_symbols` / keyword `search_code` are queryable almost immediately instead of waiting on the
  embed of every file. A detached second pass then re-scans in `EmbedMode::Inline` to fill the vectors
  in (reusing the fast pass' content-addressed caches so only not-yet-embedded content is embedded,
  bounded by `embed.max_threads`), followed by GC. The CLI `basemind scan`, the watcher, and manual
  `rescan` stay `Inline` so scripted/CI use remains deterministic. No schema or config change.
- **Index schema revision — new `refs_by_def` / `refs_by_path` Fjall partitions** back the resolved
  edges; per-file resolution facts persist as content-addressed `<hash>.rref.msgpack` blobs. This
  ships as a minor-release cut: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps at release time, wiping and rebuilding every
  `.basemind/` index + blob store on the next `basemind scan` (the resolve pass repopulates the new
  partitions). The `code_bm25_postings` / `code_bm25_by_path` partitions for the BM25 keyword lane
  (`INDEX_PARTITION_REVISION` → 4) ride the same index rebuild — the blobs are unchanged, so
  re-embedding is skipped and only the secondary index repopulates.

### Fixed

- **Code-search BM25 postings survive an embedder failure.** With `[code_search] embed = true`, a
  failed embedder load / inference / vector-count mismatch previously returned an error for the whole
  file, dropping its BM25 postings too — so a transient embedding fault silently punched keyword-lane
  holes. The scan now degrades to a keyword-only batch (chunks + BM25, no LanceDB rows, no embedded
  sidecar) and retries embedding on the next scan. BM25 is independent of embeddings and is indexed
  as such.
- **L1 extraction no longer drops (or crashes on) symbols in TSLP-fallback languages whose
  `tags.scm` leads a definition with an auxiliary capture.** The combined-L1 dispatch keyed on the
  match's *first* capture, but adapted upstream tag queries (e.g. Ruby) prepend a `@doc` capture for
  a preceding comment — so a commented `def` classified as `Other`, panicking debug builds
  (`debug_assert!`) and silently dropping the symbol in release. A single such file could abort the
  whole parallel scan, leaving the index empty. Dispatch now scans to the first capture that
  classifies to a known L1 class, recovering those symbols across every fallback grammar.
- **`rescan` rejects path parameters that escape the repository root.** The `rescan` tool took raw
  path strings and joined them straight onto the repo root, so with `scan.respect_gitignore = false`
  a `paths: ["../../etc/passwd"]` traversal would read (and index) a file outside the repo, then be
  retrievable via `workspace_grep`. Request paths now pass through the same `normalize_query_path`
  root-boundary guard as `shell_spawn`; an escaping path is rejected with `invalid_params` instead of
  being scanned. Default `respect_gitignore = true` already blocked it structurally.
- **Archives and binaries are no longer unpacked + embedded during a scan.** `should_extract_document`
  rejected nothing by default, so xberg recursively unpacked `.zip/.tar/.jar/.whl/...` and embedded
  every entry, and binary blobs (`.so/.wasm/.class/...`) were embedded to no purpose — a large,
  pointless cost that pinned ~11 cores and grew `.basemind` to gigabytes on a monorepo. A built-in
  extension + MIME denylist now skips them before any xberg work (images stay allowed for OCR).
- **Document blobs are no longer reaped by the blob GC.** Because docs weren't tracked in the index,
  `collect_referenced_hashes` never marked their `.doc.msgpack` blobs live, so the boot/background GC
  deleted the entire doc cache after every scan. Doc-tier hashes are now unioned into the live set.
- **Full scans of large repos no longer abort with a stack overflow.** Tree-sitter parse trees and the
  msgpack (de)serialization of large extraction blobs can recurse past rayon's small default worker
  stack (~2 MiB) on pathological (deeply-nested / machine-generated) files, hard-aborting the process
  on a first full scan (e.g. a freshly-checked-out git worktree; a warm rescan hid it by skipping
  unchanged files). Extraction and the resolve pass now run on a dedicated rayon pool with a 256 MiB
  per-worker stack (reserved lazily, so it costs nothing on the common shallow path).

## [0.16.0] — 2026-07-02

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 15 → 16, so every `.basemind/` index + blob store (including
`git-history.fjall/`) is wiped and rebuilt on the next `basemind scan`.

### Added

- **Resource footprint in `cache_stats` (disk + RAM).** The `cache_stats` MCP tool and
  `basemind cache stats` CLI now report a `total_bytes` that reconciles with `du` exactly, a
  per-component breakdown that **includes the `git-history.fjall/` index** (previously uncounted —
  the "1.15 GB reported vs 1.5 GB on disk" gap), an `other_bytes` catch-all so an uncounted
  directory can never silently vanish again, and process memory (`rss_bytes` + `peak_rss_bytes`) via
  a new cross-platform RSS reader (`src/sysres.rs`; mach on macOS, `/proc` + `getrusage` on Linux).
  Disk sizing now uses on-disk block counts, so Fjall's sparse journals are no longer over-reported.
  The Claude statusline gains the on-disk total + serve-process RSS.
- **Full CLI↔MCP parity.** Every MCP tool an agent can call is now reachable from the CLI: new
  `git search` (→ `search_git_history`), `governance audit` (→ `memory_audit`), `query expand`
  (→ `expand`), and a new `shells` group (`spawn`/`send`/`capture`/`kill`/`broadcast`/`list`
  → the `shell_*` tools, `--features shells`; sessions persist via the shared rmux daemon). Three
  CLI-only text primitives gained MCP tools — `delta`, `checkpoint`, `detect_waste`. A new
  `tests/cli_parity.rs` guard enumerates the advertised MCP tool set and fails if any tool lacks a
  CLI counterpart.
- **`scan.extra_roots` — index directories outside the repository root** ([#34]). Point the new
  `[scan] extra_roots = [...]` config knob at absolute paths outside the repo (e.g. a Bazel
  external repo cache, `/private/var/tmp/_bazel_<user>/<hash>/external`) and their files join the
  code map (symbol search, references, callers, outlines) and document search. External files are
  keyed by their **absolute** path — repo files stay repo-relative, so the two namespaces never
  collide and `find_references` resolves across the boundary. Missing/unreadable roots are skipped
  with a warning; a root inside the repo is ignored. Symlinks are followed (Bazel `external/` is
  symlink-heavy). Extra roots are (re-)indexed on a full `basemind scan` only — the live watcher
  does not track them — and git blame short-circuits with a clear error for external (untracked)
  files. The feature itself changes no index/blob format; a re-scan populates external files (and
  this release's `RELEASE_MINOR` bump wipes + rebuilds `.basemind/` anyway).

### Fixed

- **Git author/keyword lookups routed to the wrong tool.** `search_git_history` and `recent_changes`
  descriptions now state their contracts sharply — author/"what did X do"/keyword questions belong
  to the full-depth `search_git_history` (scans every commit reachable from HEAD), not the bounded
  100-commit `recent_changes` window. Precision is verified against real `git` at full branch depth
  by the new `tests/git_parity.rs` harness (opt-in via `BASEMIND_GIT_PARITY_REPO`).
- **Double-run lock UX.** `basemind scan` / `rescan` now pre-detect a live `basemind serve`/`watch`
  holding the store lock (via a non-blocking `probe_writer_lock`) and print an actionable notice
  naming the holder, exiting cleanly instead of colliding with a raw lock error.
- **Misleading `status` latency.** `status` uses a non-blocking read, so a multi-minute rebuild
  holding the write lock is no longer recorded as the call's wall-clock; it returns immediately with
  `rebuild_in_progress: true` when a writer is live.
- **`cache_stats` no longer hard-fails on a stale/unreadable index.** It reports sizes regardless and
  flags `blob_accounting_ok: false` when orphan accounting had to be skipped (e.g. a schema-version
  mismatch), instead of erroring out.
- **`/bm-stats` works offline.** The plugin command is now CLI-first (like `/bm-doctor`), reading
  `basemind cache stats` / `basemind telemetry` when the MCP server is disconnected.

## [0.15.1] — 2026-07-02

Patch release: docs / skills / plugin-manifest only. No schema or `RELEASE_MINOR` change, so
existing `.basemind/` caches are untouched on upgrade.

### Added

- **Dedicated per-capability skills.** Split the "use basemind" guidance into three new
  narrowly-triggerable skills alongside the existing umbrella `basemind` and `basemind-comms`:
  `basemind-code-search` (symbol search / outline / references / callers / call graph /
  implementations / `workspace_grep`), `basemind-git-history` (history / blame / diffs / churn /
  `search_git_history`), and `basemind-documents` (semantic + full-text document search, NER /
  keyword filters, and web ingestion). Mirrored into the Codex / Cursor / OpenCode plugin trees by
  `scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh`.
- **`llms.txt`.** Root-level [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) index pointing agents at the
  capability skills, docs, and config schema.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-07-02

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 14 → 15, so every `.basemind/` index + blob store (including
`git-history.fjall/`) is wiped and rebuilt on the next `basemind scan` — which is also how existing
repos populate the new git-history full-text search index.

### Added

- **`search_git_history` — full-text search over commit history.** Search commit **author name +
  email** and **message summary + full body**, tokenized (lowercased, split on non-alphanumeric)
  and matched as an AND. `field` scopes to `author`, `message`, or `all` (default); `limit` +
  `cursor` paginate like the other git-log tools. Backed by two new git-history partitions — a
  `gh_term_to_ords` inverted term→commit-ordinal index (reusing the newest-first delta-varint
  posting encoding) and a `gh_commit_text_by_ord` body store kept out of the head-decode hot path.
  When the git-history index isn't fresh (read-only session / mid-build) the tool degrades to a
  bounded live walk over the recent window, flagged `partial` (author + summary only). To support
  it, commit extraction now captures `author_email` + full `body`, and the stored commit-meta head
  gains an `author_email` field (`sha ‖ time ‖ author ‖ email ‖ summary ‖ files`).

### Fixed

- **Multi-session MCP contention: the writer→read-only downgrade race.** A `basemind serve` that
  rightfully held the `.basemind/.lock` write lock could still come up read-only when a concurrent
  reader transiently held Fjall's single-holder index lock — leaving the repo with *zero* writers
  (no auto-scan / watcher / rescan → a silently stale index). Fixed on both single-holder Fjall
  stores: the writer now **retries** a transient `Locked` on open (it already owns `.basemind/.lock`,
  so the contention always clears), read-only openers **probe `.basemind/.lock` and skip the Fjall
  open** entirely when a writer is live (serving from the concurrently-readable blobs), and the
  schema-version check no longer does a throwaway **double-open** that widened the race window. The
  downgrade log now names the real lock holder instead of always blaming "another serve".

### Changed

- **git-history / index / comms Fjall opens** collapsed to a single `Database` open + inline schema
  read (was: a throwaway peek-open before the real open). `GIT_HISTORY_SCHEMA` bumps `+4 → +5` for
  the FTS commit-meta layout, wiping and rebuilding `.basemind/git-history.fjall/` on the next scan
  — a no-op for released users (the git-history index only became user-visible with this release).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-30

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 13 → 14 (a new `SymbolKind::Heading` variant), so every
`.basemind/` index + blob store is wiped and rebuilt on the next `basemind scan` — which is also how
existing repos pick up Markdown headings.

### Added — Markdown / Obsidian support

Markdown files (already parsed, but previously yielding no symbols) are now a first-class surface:
point basemind at an Obsidian vault or any Markdown notes directory and the code-map tools work over
it the same way they do over source. All of this is on by default — `.md` is scanned like any other
file, headings ship via a `src/queries/markdown.scm` override, and the reference graph is harvested
by a fence-aware byte-scan in `extract/l2.rs` (the tree-sitter block grammar models none of these
inline constructs).

- **Headings → outline.** ATX (`#`…`######`) and setext headings become `Heading` symbols, so
  `outline` and `search_symbols` (optionally `kind: "heading"`) navigate a note's structure.
- **Wikilinks → backlinks.** `[[Note]]`, `[[Note#Heading|alias]]`, and `![[Embed]]` become
  references, so `find_references "Note"` returns the notes linking to it. Targets resolve by note
  name (`#anchor` and `|alias` stripped), matching Obsidian.
- **Standard Markdown links → backlinks.** `[text](Note.md)` / `![alt](img/Diagram.png)` also become
  references, normalized to the same note name (directory, `.md`, `#anchor` stripped, `%20`
  decoded), so wikilink and Markdown-link vaults share one backlink graph. External URLs
  (`http(s)://`, `mailto:`) and bare `#anchor` links are ignored.
- **Tags → graph.** Inline `#tag` / nested `#area/sub` and YAML frontmatter `tags:` (both `[a, b]`
  and `- a` list forms) become references keyed on the leading `#`, so `find_references "#project"`
  lists every note carrying that tag. Tags inside fenced code blocks are skipped.

Not yet mapped (deliberate follow-ups): block references (`^id`, `[[Note#^id]]`), frontmatter
aliases / arbitrary properties, and task/callout items.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-30

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 12 → 13, so every `.basemind/` index + blob store is
wiped and rebuilt on the next `basemind scan` (intentional; no action needed).

### Fixed

- **`serve` watcher no longer pegs multi-core CPU on gitignored / nested-`.basemind` churn
  (#33).** A writer `serve` watching an umbrella repo woke on every filesystem event except those
  under its *own* `.basemind/`, then ran a no-op incremental scan that still re-serialized the
  index (`store.flush`) and rebuilt the **entire** `MapCache` over the whole corpus — on every
  debounced batch. With nested child repos each flushing their own `.basemind/` in a mutual loop
  (or any `node_modules` / build churn) this rebuilt the cache indefinitely. Three fixes:
  - The watcher now drops every event a full scan would never index — including **nested**
    child-repo `.basemind/` writes — before waking a rescan, honoring the **full nested
    `.gitignore` hierarchy** (via the `ignore` crate) plus the configured exclude globs. The
    incremental `scan_paths` is now gitignore-aware too, matching full-scan semantics.
  - `scan_paths` short-circuits when a batch changes nothing indexable — no `store.flush`, no
    work.
  - `scan_and_refresh` updates the `MapCache` **incrementally** for the changed paths (re-reading
    only those blobs) instead of rebuilding the whole corpus, and skips the rebuild and
    cache-generation bump entirely when nothing changed (which no longer needlessly invalidates
    paginating clients' cursors).
  - Note: on macOS, FSEvents is kernel-recursive, so excluded subtrees cannot be un-watched;
    their events are now filtered in-process in microseconds instead of triggering a rebuild.

### Changed

- Extracted the scanner's path-filtering (`Filters`, the new `IndexFilter`) into
  `src/scanner_filter.rs` to keep `scanner.rs` under the 1000-line cap.

## [0.12.2] — 2026-06-29

Patch release: blob and index formats are unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 12), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild.

### Changed

- **`tree-sitter-language-pack` `1.9.0-rc.45` → `1.12.0`.** The grammar bootstrap
  (`ensure_grammars`) now uses tslp's `prefetch`, which probes real on-disk loadability
  instead of the in-memory `has_language` registry — replacing basemind's hand-rolled
  `DownloadManager::ensure_languages` workaround for the pre-1.12 `download()` short-circuit.
  tslp 1.12's lock-free static `get_language` fast path also removes a global-mutex hop on the
  per-thread parser pool's hot path (tree-sitter is ~30% of scan time). Validated against the
  full harden harness: all 8 OSS repos pass with 0 extraction failures and scan times at or
  under baseline.

Patch release: blob and index formats are unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 12), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild.

### Fixed

- **Multiple concurrent sessions on one repo no longer break code-map navigation.** fjall takes
  an exclusive directory lock, so only one `basemind serve` process can open a repo's index at a
  time; additional editor/agent sessions fall back to read-only and previously got an error
  (`read_only_index_unavailable`) from every fjall-backed tool — the reported "blocked / not
  responsive". `find_references`, `find_callers`, `find_implementations`, and `call_graph` now
  answer from in-RAM indexes built from the content-addressed blobs (which are concurrently
  readable), so unlimited sessions work against one repo: one writer on fjall, N readers on the
  shared blobs. `outline` / `search_symbols` / `dependents` / git tools already worked read-only.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-29

Minor release: the document/RAG and web-crawl engines move to their renamed,
MIT-relicensed crates. `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps to 12, so the blob + index formats
are considered incompatible — `.basemind/` is wiped and rebuilt from source on
the next `basemind scan`.

### Changed

- **Document tier now builds on `xberg` `1.0.0-rc.1`** (was `kreuzberg` `5.0.0-rc.35`)
  and the web-crawl tier on `crawlberg` `1.0.1` (was `kreuzcrawl` `0.3.0-rc.55`). These
  are the renamed, **MIT-licensed** successors of the same engines, so the `documents`,
  `memory`, and `crawl` feature surfaces are unchanged. The `Elastic-2.0` license
  exceptions for the old crates are dropped from `deny.toml`.
- **Document extraction migrated to xberg's async `extract` API.** xberg 1.0 removed the
  synchronous `extract_file_sync` wrapper; the scanner's doc path now drives the async
  `extract(ExtractInput, &ExtractionConfig)` on a shared multi-thread runtime and reads the
  per-document result out of the new batch-shaped `ExtractionResult.results`.
- **`arc-swap` `1.9.1` → `1.9.2`** via `cargo upgrade`. `arrow-array` / `arrow-schema`
  stay pinned to `58` to match lancedb 0.30's transitive arrow.
- **Web crawling now blocks private/loopback/link-local targets by default** (SSRF
  protection inherited from crawlberg 1.0). `web_scrape` / `web_crawl` / `web_map` against
  `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`, etc. are rejected with an SSRF-policy
  violation. A new `crawl.allow_private_network` config flag (default `false`) re-enables
  them for internal-docs hosts you control; the `CRAWLBERG_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK` env var is
  also honoured as a process-wide override.

### Fixed

- **Status line no longer renders blank on Linux** — `build_basemind_line` read file mtimes
  with BSD `stat -f %m` first. On GNU coreutils `-f` means "display filesystem status" and
  *succeeds*, printing a multi-line blob instead of failing, so the `|| stat -c %Y` fallback
  never ran; under `set -euo pipefail` the blob's bare `File` word aborted the command
  substitution as an unbound variable, emptying the whole line. An `epoch_mtime` helper now
  tries GNU `stat -c %Y` first and falls back to BSD `stat -f %m` only when `-c` genuinely
  fails (macOS), used at both mtime call sites (#32).

Patch release: blob and index formats are unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 11), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild. A `tar` security bump on the npm installer, a Homebrew-tap fix, and
raised runtime floors.

### Security

- **npm installer bumps `tar` 6 → 7.5.16** (GHSA-vmf3-w455-68vh) — the bundled extractor was on a
  `tar` line whose PAX size-override parsing differential allows file smuggling. The fix only exists
  in `tar` 7.5.16+, which is ESM-only and requires Node ≥ 18; `install.js` now pulls `tar` in via a
  dynamic `import()` at the extract site, and the npm package's engine floor moves to Node ≥ 22.

### Fixed

- **Homebrew tap no longer breaks on Intel hosts** — the generated formula's `on_intel` block called
  `odie` at formula-load time, which aborted every `brew` command that read the tap on an Intel Mac
  (poisoning bottle builds and installs for *all* formulae in the tap, not just basemind). The
  Apple-Silicon-only constraint is now expressed via `depends_on arch: :arm64`, evaluated at install
  time instead of load time.

### Changed

- **Runtime floors raised** — the npm package (Node ≥ 22, was ≥ 14) and the opencode plugin
  (Node ≥ 22, was ≥ 18); pip package requires Python ≥ 3.10 (was ≥ 3.8). Older runtimes are
  end-of-life.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-26

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps to 11, so the blob and Fjall index formats are considered
stale and every `.basemind/` is wiped and rebuilt from source on the next `basemind scan` (one-time,
intentional). The headline is a precomputed git-history index that turns the history MCP tools from
full-walk-per-query into sub-millisecond lookups, plus an install fix that unblocks Apple Silicon
Macs running an x86_64 shell, Node, or Python under Rosetta.

### Added

- **Precomputed git-history Fjall index** — `commits_touching`, `find_commits_by_path`, and
  `symbol_history` previously walked the commit graph on every call, paying an O(history) cost per
  query. They are now backed by a per-repo Fjall index built once at scan time and refreshed
  incrementally for new commits, so queries are O(result) sub-millisecond lookups. Posting lists are
  stored newest-first, keeping `commits_touching` O(n) in the returned commits rather than in total
  history depth.

### Fixed

- **Apple Silicon installs under Rosetta no longer abort** — `uname -m`, `os.arch()`, and
  `platform.machine()` all report the *process* architecture, so an x86_64 shell, Node, or Python
  running under Rosetta reports `x86_64` on Apple Silicon hardware. All three installers (the shell
  launcher, npm `install.js`, pip `downloader.py`) matched the Darwin/x86_64 branch and aborted with
  "Intel macOS not supported", even though the native arm64 binary runs fine. They now probe a
  hardware-level signal the translation layer cannot spoof (`sysctl -n hw.optional.arm64`) and
  resolve `aarch64-apple-darwin` whenever that probe — or the reported arch — indicates arm64.
  Fixes #28.
- **Windows `harden` test compiles again** — the new on-disk index-size measurement used
  `std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt::blocks()` unconditionally, breaking the `windows-latest` test
  leg's compile. The block-count path is now `cfg(unix)`-gated with a `len()` fallback on other
  platforms.

### Performance

- **Path-scoped history walks** — `commit_touches_path` computed the full recursive tree diff of
  every walked commit just to test membership of one path, so a single history query over a deep
  monorepo could run for minutes (measured >5 min on a 242k-commit repo). It now looks up the entry
  at the exact path in the commit tree and each parent via `gix` `lookup_entry` (O(path depth) object
  reads, no sibling recursion), comparing `(blob oid, mode)`. Semantics are identical to
  `git log --full-history -- <path>`; the same query drops to ~11 s worst case and ~2.5 s typical.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — bumped the embedded `rmux` shells trio (`rmux-client` / `rmux-sdk` /
  `rmux-server`) from 0.6 to 0.7 and refreshed the lockfile for compatible updates. `arrow` stays
  pinned at 58 to match what `lancedb` resolves transitively.

## [0.10.3] — 2026-06-25

Patch release: blob and index formats are unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 10), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild. Three Windows-only correctness fixes surfaced once the comms suite and the
full tool sweep run on the `windows-latest` CI leg, plus install/release hardening so a partial
publish can no longer leave the plugin launcher unable to install.

### Fixed

- **Windows full scan now produces `/`-separated index keys** — the full-scan walker was optimized
  to feed `Path::to_str()` straight into the index without the `\`→`/` normalization the incremental
  `scan_paths` path still did, so on Windows every nested file was keyed with backslashes
  (`vendored\inner.rs`) and forward-slash lookups missed — breaking all subdirectory queries
  (outline / search / references for any file not at the repo root). Normalize at the walker source;
  the extra allocation is Windows-only and never touches the Unix hot path.
- **Windows comms named pipe now isolates by `comms_dir`** — `comms_socket_path` derived the
  Windows pipe name from the username only (`\\.\pipe\basemind-comms-<user>`), ignoring
  `BASEMIND_COMMS_DIR`, so every comms dir on a host collapsed onto one per-user singleton pipe.
  Parallel comms suites (each isolated to its own tempdir) collided — daemons cross-contaminated,
  one test's teardown killed another's daemon, and concurrent `comms start` races hung to the CI
  timeout. The pipe name now mixes in a hash of `comms_dir`, mirroring the per-dir Unix socket;
  production (which leaves `BASEMIND_COMMS_DIR` unset) keeps a single stable per-user broker. A
  `timeout-minutes: 30` backstop on the CI test job prevents any future hang from blocking the
  queue-not-cancel main concurrency.
- **Windows `comms start` no longer hangs** — the detached broker daemon inherited the launcher's
  stdout/stderr: on Windows `CreateProcess` runs with `bInheritHandles = TRUE` whenever stdio is
  redirected, leaking every inheritable handle into the child — including the pipe a parent captured
  via `Command::output()` (or `serve`'s MCP stdio). The long-lived daemon then held the write end
  open, so the capturing parent never saw EOF and blocked until the daemon died. Unix is immune
  (`Stdio::null` dup2's `/dev/null` over the child fds and Rust sets `CLOEXEC` on its own pipes).
  `spawn_detached_daemon` now clears `HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT` on its std handles before the detached
  spawn, so the daemon inherits none of them; the real-daemon comms E2E suite runs on Windows again.
- **Plugin launcher names an incomplete release instead of failing opaquely** — when a pinned
  release is missing a platform binary or its checksums file (a partial publish, as 0.10.0 was),
  `mcp-launch.sh` died with a bare "download failed" / "could not fetch checksums" that the MCP
  client surfaced only as "failed to connect". It now reports the release as incomplete and tells
  the user to update the plugin (Claude Code: `/plugin update`) to a complete release.
- **Releases publish atomically** — `create_release` made the GitHub release live before its
  binaries finished uploading, so a failed platform build (as 0.10.0's Linux legs) left it
  half-populated with no checksums, and the launcher's checksum-verified download then fails closed
  for every user pinned to it. The release is now created as a **draft**; a `finalize_release` job
  promotes it only once all four platform archives **and** the checksums file are present (and the
  npm / PyPI / Homebrew publishes gate on that finalize, since they download from the release). A
  failed platform build now leaves a hidden draft, never a live, broken release.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-06-25

Patch release: blob and index formats are unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 10), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild. Fixes the Linux release archive, which 0.10.1 shipped broken on a clean host.

### Fixed

- **Linux release binaries: bundled libraries could not find their siblings** — the archive
  bundles native `.so`s (libheif, libaom, …) into `lib/`, but only the main binary carried the
  `$ORIGIN/lib` rpath. A bundled lib with a sibling dependency (`libheif.so.1` → `libaom.so.3`,
  both in `lib/`) had no rpath of its own, so on a clean host the loader failed with
  `libaom.so.3: cannot open shared object file` — even on `basemind --version`. The in-container
  packaging smoke missed it because the build container has those codecs system-installed.
  `package-release.sh` now sets `$ORIGIN` on every bundled lib so sibling-to-sibling deps resolve,
  verified by running the real release artifact on a clean glibc-2.28 host.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-06-25

Patch release: blob and index formats are unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 10), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild. This release completes the 0.10.0 distribution — it ships the Linux
binaries and the npm / PyPI / Homebrew packages that 0.10.0 could not produce.

### Fixed

- **Linux release binaries (x86_64 + aarch64)** — the 0.10.0 Linux build linked ort's prebuilt
  ONNX Runtime with `cargo-zigbuild`, which fails because zig links LLVM `libc++` while the
  prebuilt is built against GNU `libstdc++`. The Linux binaries now build inside the official
  `manylinux_2_28` containers with native gcc. The prebuilt ort also references glibc 2.38 symbols
  (`__isoc23_strtol/ll/ull`, `__libc_single_threaded`); a small compatibility shim
  (`scripts/glibc228_compat.c`) backfills them so the binaries keep a **GLIBC_2.28** floor
  (RHEL 8 / Debian 11 / Ubuntu 20.04+ / Amazon Linux 2023). Because 0.10.0's binary legs failed,
  its checksums and the npm / PyPI / Homebrew publishes were skipped; 0.10.1 carries the same
  source and completes every distribution channel.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-24

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 9 → 10, so the on-disk index version changes and every
`.basemind/` cache rebuilds from source on the next `scan`. This rebuild is **one-time and
harmless** — the blob and index formats are unchanged.

### Added

- **Agent shells: embedded rmux daemon + six MCP tools** — spawn detached headless shell sessions
  via `shell_spawn` with optional cwd, env overrides, and title. Drive sessions with `shell_send`
  (write stdin), `shell_capture` (visible screen), `shell_broadcast` (multicast input), `shell_list`
  (enumerate with liveness), and `shell_kill` (terminate). basemind embeds the daemon (re-execs
  itself with `--__internal-daemon` — no external `rmux` binary). Sessions are long-lived across
  tool calls and driven headless via MCP.
- **Visual attach** (Unix + Windows) — when `[shells].visual` is not `headless`, `shell_spawn` opens
  the session in a terminal tab/window attached to it via a hidden `basemind --__internal-attach`
  re-exec (macOS / Linux emulators or Windows Terminal `wt.exe`; basemind ships no external `rmux`
  binary). Presentation is best-effort — a spawn never fails just because no terminal could be driven
  — and the response's `attach_command` is returned for manual re-attach.
- **Comms-coupled session rooms** (Unix + Windows, `comms` feature) — spawned children auto-join a
  session-scoped comms room via inherited `BASEMIND_SESSION_ID` / `BASEMIND_PARENT_AGENT_ID` /
  `BASEMIND_AGENT_ID`, enabling bidirectional parent↔child messaging and forming parent→child
  inheritance chains across agents.
- **`[shells]` configuration sub-tree** — controls visual presentation mode (`current` / `window` /
  `web` / `headless`; default `current` = new tab in open terminal), terminal emulator choice
  (`auto` / `iterm2` / `terminal_app` / `windows_terminal` / `gnome_terminal` / `konsole` /
  `wezterm` / `alacritty` / `kitty` / `xterm`), and session pty dimensions (`default_cols` /
  `default_rows`) and lifecycle (`keep_on_exit`). Requires `--features shells`.
- **Multi-agent comms orchestration** — one `serve` now drives many named sub-identities over a
  single connection via a per-call `as_agent` parameter, backed by a per-identity broker-client
  registry parented to the orchestrator. New `dm_send` delivers a direct message into another
  agent's inbox over a private pairwise room; `agent_register` / `agent_list` advertise and discover
  the live roster. The whole surface is mirrored on the CLI (`basemind comms … --as-agent`, `dm`,
  `room-for-path`), and a `multi-agent-room` skill + a code-review-panel demo show the pattern.
- **Per-repo comms rooms + recency** — agents auto-join a default room keyed by the repo, created on
  demand via `get_or_create_chat_room_for_path`; `Global` is repurposed for machine-wide ops
  coordination. Reads are recency-aware: `room_history` / `inbox_read` default to the last 24h
  (`since_hours` widens, `0` reads the full append-only log), each message carries `age_secs`, and
  `room_list` flags a room `stale` after 7 days of silence.
- **Windows support for agent comms + shells** — the comms broker (named-pipe transport, singleton,
  signal handling) and the embedded rmux shell runtime now build and run on Windows, and the comms
  MCP tools are exposed there. `--features full` therefore ships agent comms and agent shells on
  every published platform — macOS, Linux, and Windows — not Unix only. A dedicated Windows CI job
  builds and tests the `comms` + `shells` surface.

### Changed

- **Dependency refresh** — kreuzberg `5.0.0-rc.30` → `rc.35` (document-tier extraction stack) and
  `rmcp` `1.7` → `1.8`. `arrow` stays at 58 (lock-step with lancedb 0.30). rmcp 1.8 deprecates MCP
  logging (SEP-2577); basemind keeps the capability for now since the status line and `rescan`
  progress depend on it.
- **Linux release binaries target glibc 2.28** (RHEL 8 / Debian 11 / Ubuntu 20.04+ / Amazon Linux
  2023) — the two `*-unknown-linux-gnu` artifacts are built with `cargo-zigbuild` (zig as the
  linker), pinning the required glibc symbol floor without changing runtime behaviour (still
  dynamically linked). A CI `objdump` guard fails the build if a dependency pulls a newer symbol.
  macOS / Windows artifacts are unchanged.

### Removed

- **Experimental A2A server (`--features a2a`)** — the gRPC + JSON-RPC/SSE Agent-to-Agent server,
  its protobuf codegen + `proto/`, the `basemind a2a serve` command, the buf CI job, and the
  a2a-only dependency stack (tonic, prost, axum, axum-server, tower, tower-http, rustls, reqwest,
  subtle, rcgen, …) are removed. It was opt-in and never part of the shipped release surface; the
  maintenance cost (pinned codegen, held-back deps, a dedicated buf CI job) outweighed its
  experimental value. The comms agent-card shapes stay A2A-schema-aligned, so an HTTP front-end can
  still be added behind the `CommsFrontend` trait later without it.

### Fixed

- **Comms daemons no longer pile up** — a busy broker that missed a single liveness ping could be
  wrongly judged dead and have its socket unlinked-and-rebound by a new daemon, orphaning the
  original on a dangling socket that nothing reaped promptly; across many sessions dozens
  accumulated. Two guards: the liveness probe now retries before declaring a daemon dead (so a
  live-but-busy broker is not reclaimed), and a Unix socket-ownership watchdog makes any daemon
  whose socket was unlinked or replaced self-terminate within seconds instead of lingering as an
  orphan.
- **Comms daemon takes over a previous build on load** — when a serve or CLI brings up the broker
  and finds the socket held by an older or protocol-incompatible daemon, it now asks that daemon to
  stop and spawns a current one in its place, converging the singleton on the newest binary; if the
  predecessor will not yield, it errors out clearly (naming the version + pid) instead of silently
  talking to an incompatible daemon — which is how the pre-0.10 skew surfaced as an opaque
  "connection closed". A same-version (or newer) daemon is reused, so concurrent sessions still
  share one broker.
- **Comms messages now expire** — the broker prunes messages past a 7-day TTL on startup and hourly
  thereafter, so the user-global comms store cannot grow without bound. Recency-aware reads already
  hid old messages; this reclaims their storage. Room records and per-room sequence counters are
  left intact so read cursors stay monotonic.
- **Concurrent serve sessions no longer collide** (#26, #27) — the editor plugin spawns one
  `basemind serve` per session, but the store write lock is single-holder. A contending serve now
  starts in a **read-only** mode (instead of exiting and handing the MCP client an opaque `-32000`),
  so its tools register and the session is usable: `outline`, `search_symbols`, `list_files`,
  `dependents`, `workspace_grep`, and the git tools answer from the in-RAM map and git. Fjall takes
  an exclusive lock on its index, so the call/reference tools (`find_references`, `find_callers`,
  `find_implementations`, `call_graph`) cannot read it from a second process — they now return a
  clear "held by another basemind serve" error rather than a misleading empty result. The
  lock-holding serve stays the sole writer; a read-only serve's `rescan` returns the same clear
  error. Lock contention fails fast with the clean lock message rather than the multi-GB busy-spin
  reported on 0.9.0 (#26).
- **Agent-shells hardening** — `shell_spawn` now honours the `[shells].enabled` master switch,
  confines `cwd` to the repository root (rejecting `..` / absolute escapes), threads the configured
  `default_cols` / `default_rows` into the spawned pty, validates `BASEMIND_SHELLS_SOCKET` on the
  client path, rejects carriage returns in env keys/values, and widens the loader-injection warning
  list (`LD_AUDIT`, `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`). The shells and comms modules build cleanly on
  both Unix and Windows (see Added); a build without those features still excludes them entirely.
- **Status line recognizes pre-0.9 indexes** — the basemind status line keyed its "scanned yet?"
  check on the fused `.fm` blob introduced in 0.9, so an index written by an earlier binary (split
  `.l1`/`.l2` blobs) showed "scanning…" indefinitely though it was healthy. It now accepts both
  layouts and never double-counts the secondary blob layer.

### Security

- **`quinn-proto` bumped to 0.11.15** (RUSTSEC-2026-0185) — fixes a remote memory-exhaustion vector
  via unbounded out-of-order QUIC stream reassembly, pulled transitively under `--features full`.
- Known/tracked advisories carried this release (no fix available yet): `bincode` 1.3.3 unmaintained
  (via `rmux-proto`), `memmap2` 0.9.10 unsound pointer offset (via `lancedb`, documents/memory).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-23

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 8 → 9, so the on-disk index version changes and every
`.basemind/` cache rebuilds from source on the next `scan`. This rebuild is **structural** — the
per-file extraction blob format changed from two files (`<hash>.l1.msgpack` + `<hash>.l2.msgpack`)
to one combined frame (`<hash>.fm.msgpack`); any old split blobs left on disk are reclaimed by
`cache gc`. A scanner hot-path pass cuts cold-scan wall time ~22%. Bumps kreuzberg to `5.0.0-rc.30`.

### Changed

- **Scanner: ~22% faster cold scans** — two flamegraph-ranked wins. (1) Per-file Fjall index commits
  are now batched per rayon worker (256 files per commit), removing the ~14% of scan time worker
  threads spent serializing on Fjall's single write lock. (2) The L1 outline and L2 calls are fused
  into one content-addressed blob (`<hash>.fm.msgpack`), so the default eager-L2 scan does one
  `open` + atomic `rename` per file instead of two. Measured min-of-7 cold scans on a 6.7k-file repo:
  2.68 s → 2.07 s; the per-file read-before-write index atomicity is preserved.
- Bump **kreuzberg to `5.0.0-rc.30`** — picks up the upstream Tesseract `tessdata`-path fix, so the
  released binary resolves trained data at runtime instead of baking in the build runner's path.
  Resolves #12.
- Dependency refresh to latest compatible (gix 0.85, criterion 0.8, …). arrow stays at 58 to match
  lancedb 0.30; the experimental `a2a` feature's gRPC deps are held pending a tonic-0.14 migration.

### Fixed

- **Comms daemons no longer leak across sessions.** A daemon orphaned by a dead session (reparented
  to pid 1) used to keep its socket + flock and never exit, so they accumulated indefinitely. The
  broker now tracks connected links + last activity and self-terminates after 30 min with no clients,
  via the normal drain path. A live client (even a quiet subscriber) keeps it alive. Unix-only.
- Removed the document-tier troubleshooting workarounds from the README now that both upstream
  kreuzberg bugs are fixed (TLS-MITM in rc.29, `tessdata` in rc.30). Resolves #14.

### Removed

- The pre-0.9 split-tier blob format (`.l1.msgpack` / `.l2.msgpack`), superseded by the combined
  `.fm.msgpack` frame. `cache gc` reclaims any left behind by the schema-bump refresh.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-22

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 7 → 8, so the on-disk index version changes and every
`.basemind/` cache rebuilds from source on the next `scan` (one-time; the blob/index formats are
unchanged, so the rebuild is harmless). Deepens the MCP surface — prompts, argument completions,
logging, and progress notifications — and hardens the consumer experience: cleaner document-tier
scans, a cold-start scan path agents can invoke, serve diagnostics, and a recovery runbook. Bumps
kreuzberg to `5.0.0-rc.29`.

### Added

- **MCP prompts** (`prompts/list` + `prompts/get`) — four reusable, parameterized workflows that
  teach a client to drive basemind structure-first: `onboard-repo`, `trace-symbol`, `explain-file`,
  `review-working-tree`.
- **MCP argument completion** (`completion/complete`) — autocompletes prompt arguments from the
  in-RAM code map: `trace-symbol`'s `symbol` against indexed symbol names, `explain-file`'s `path`
  against indexed file paths (pure prefix scan, no store lock).
- **MCP logging + progress** — `logging/setLevel` plus a `rescan_complete` log with scan counts,
  and start/done progress notifications on `rescan` when the client supplies a progress token.
- **Tool annotations** on every MCP tool (`read_only_hint` / `destructive_hint` / `idempotent_hint`
  / `open_world_hint`) so clients (Claude Code et al.) can auto-approve read-only tools and only
  prompt for mutating ones.
- **Cold-start indexing for agents** — a `bm-scan` command + `basemind-scan` skill that run
  `basemind scan` via the CLI (no MCP server required), so an agent can build the index when
  basemind reports "no index".
- **Recovery runbook** — a `bm-doctor` command + `basemind-doctor` skill: diagnose the index, detect
  a stale lock via the `.lock.meta` holder pid, rebuild via scan, and reconnect the MCP server
  (client-specific). Plus `basemind serve` now logs its lifecycle (startup pid/version/view and the
  exact exit reason) to its stderr / the client's MCP server logs.

### Changed

- Bump **kreuzberg to `5.0.0-rc.29`** — picks up the TLS-certificate fix for model downloads behind
  corporate TLS-MITM proxies (`hf-hub` now uses the platform `native-tls` provider, honoring the OS
  cert store + `SSL_CERT_FILE`/`SSL_CERT_DIR`). Resolves #14.

### Fixed

- The document tier no longer counts non-extractable files as failures. A file tree-sitter doesn't
  recognize as code (e.g. an Erlang `.app.src`, which `mime_guess` maps to
  `application/x-wais-source`) is now **skipped** — and logged at debug — instead of inflating the
  failed count; genuine extraction errors on real documents still count as failures.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-22

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 6 → 7, so the on-disk index version changes and every
`.basemind/` cache rebuilds from source on the next `scan` (intentional, one-time). The headline is a
first-class **code-aware token-reduction** surface (the `compress`/`expand` tools, per-call budgets,
TOON encoding, behavioral output compression) plus **code-grounded memory/skill governance**
(`memory_audit` + git-mined skill proposals). Also ships MCP tool annotations so clients can
auto-approve read-only tools, and a sweep of CLI/MCP bug fixes.

### Added

- **`compress` MCP tool** — code-aware compression (tree-sitter structural elision + cheap lexical
  passes) with an honest before/after token report; **`expand`** pulls a single symbol's body back.
- **Per-call `max_tokens` budgets** on high-volume tools (`outline`, `search_*`, `find_references`,
  `workspace_grep`, `search_documents`, …): rank-to-fit with an explicit truncation marker + cursor.
- **Opt-in TOON encoding** (`format:"toon"`) for high-volume list responses, and an opt-in **lean
  tool surface** (`BASEMIND_MCP_LEAN`) that advertises three wrapper tools instead of the full set.
- **Behavioral output compression** (`basemind compress-output`/`delta`/`checkpoint`/`detect-waste`)
  with credential-safe, fail-open semantics, plus opt-in plugin hooks (Bash-output compression,
  read-cache deltas).
- **Code-grounded governance** — `memory_audit` verifies stored memories against the live code map
  (structural-hash drift → stale, decay + 90-day auto-archive) and git-mined **skill proposals**
  (`proposals_mine`/`proposals_list`/`proposal_accept`/`proposal_reject`); additive
  provenance/verification fields on `MemoryRecord` and two new lazy Fjall keyspaces.
- **MCP tool annotations** on all tools (`read_only_hint`/`destructive_hint`/`idempotent_hint`/
  `open_world_hint`) so consumers (Claude Code et al.) can auto-approve read-only tools.
- **Real tokenizer-backed token counts** (o200k under `documents`) in the compress report and
  telemetry, and instructive `-32602` parameter errors via a `Lenient<T>` wrapper + serde aliases
  (accept `query`/`pattern`/`needle`/`name`/`regex`/… across the search tools).
- Plugin integrations for **Kimi Code** and **pi**, and a Codex-readable marketplace manifest.

### Changed

- Bump **kreuzberg to `5.0.0-rc.28`**.
- Honest telemetry: `est_tokens_saved` now credits document/list/web tools instead of reporting 0,
  and `search_symbols.total` (`total_is_partial`) / `list_files.limit_clamped` / `status.blob_count`
  expose what was previously silent.
- `scan` / `rescan` exit `0` when per-file read failures occur but the index was still updated
  (previously exit 2 masked a successful scan); `scan --rev` skips submodule gitlinks instead of
  failing; `-q`/`--quiet` now suppresses subsystem INFO/WARN logs.
- `cache clear` gains a `views:<name>` selector to clear a single view without nuking all of them.
- Slimmer tool descriptions to cut per-session schema tokens.

### Fixed

- Lock-contention errors now name the actual holder (`serve`/`watch`/`scan`/`rescan`) via a `.lock`
  sidecar instead of always guessing `watch` (#11).
- `query` commands resolve absolute and `./`-prefixed paths to the indexed key (#19); serving or
  querying a never-scanned named view now errors instead of silently returning empty (#18).
- `comms status` gives an actionable "daemon not running — start with `basemind comms start`" message
  (#21); comms verbs no longer emit a false "`--json` has no effect" warning (#20).
- `git_cache_bytes` documented as the disk layer only (#23); CLI lock / LanceStore-shutdown crashes
  and legacy comms front-matter decoding fixed.
- Known upstream issues in the document tier (OCR `tessdata` path #12, model download behind a
  TLS-MITM proxy #14) are documented with workarounds; fixes tracked in kreuzberg and picked up on a
  later bump.

## [0.6.3] — 2026-06-21

Patch release: schema unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 6). Reworks the plugin MCP launcher so it
no longer depends on `npx`/`uvx` at runtime — fixing intermittent start-up failures when several
agent sessions (or the comms-monitor poll loop) launch basemind concurrently.

### Fixed

- **Plugin launcher npx/uvx race** — `scripts/mcp-launch.sh` previously exec'd `npx basemind@<ver>`
  (then `uvx`) as the runtime. npx stages into a shared, spec-hashed `~/.npm/_npx/<hash>` directory,
  so two concurrent launches raced on it and failed with `ENOENT … package.json`; the binary was also
  never cached, so every launch re-resolved over the network and inherited node/python start-up cost
  plus lavamoat postinstall blocks. The launcher now has a single install method: download the
  checksum-verified prebuilt release binary once into a stable per-user cache
  (`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/basemind/bin/<version>/`), serialized with an atomic lock, and exec it
  directly on every subsequent launch. `npx`/`uvx` and the `BASEMIND_LAUNCHER` override are removed;
  set `BASEMIND_BIN=/path/to/basemind` to point at a local dev build. The npm/PyPI/Homebrew/cargo
  install channels are unchanged.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-06-21

Patch release: schema unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 6). Fixes the macOS binary so the
npm/PyPI/Homebrew/cargo wrappers actually run — 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 shipped an unrunnable macOS binary.

### Fixed

- **macOS binary SIGKILL on launch** — the release packaging bundles non-system dylibs into `lib/`
  and rewrites their `@loader_path` install names with `install_name_tool`, which edits the Mach-O in
  place and invalidates the linker's ad-hoc code signature. macOS then killed the process on first
  page-in (`SIGKILL`, "Code Signature Invalid") with no output, so the binary downloaded by every
  wrapper was unrunnable. The packaging now re-signs each dylib and the binary ad-hoc **after** the
  rewrites and verifies `--strict` before packaging.
- **pip/uvx downloader** — a stale or partial `~/.cache/basemind/<ver>/` made `os.replace()` fail with
  `Errno 66` (cannot overwrite a non-empty directory), wedging installs until a manual cache wipe. The
  downloader now clears a stale cache dir under its lock and retries the atomic move.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-21

Patch release: blob/index/comms schema unchanged (`RELEASE_MINOR` stays 6), so no
`.basemind/` rebuild. Fixes the Windows release build that blocked the 0.6.0 wrapper publish.

### Fixed

- **Windows build** — the agent-comms substrate is built on Unix domain sockets
  (`UnixStream`/`UnixListener`, peer-cred auth) with no Windows analogue, but `comms`
  imported `tokio::net::UnixStream` ungated, so the `--features full` `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  build failed to compile (since comms landed in 0.5.0). This failed the Windows binary job and
  held back the npm/PyPI/Homebrew publishes. The comms surface is now gated on
  `all(feature = "comms", unix)` — on Windows the binary compiles with comms absent; unix is
  unchanged. 0.6.0 published to crates.io only; 0.6.1 is the first complete cross-channel release
  of the 0.6 line.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-20

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 5 → 6, so the blob, Fjall-index, and LanceDB schema versions
advance — the first `basemind scan` / `serve` after upgrading **wipes and rebuilds the `.basemind/`
cache and the LanceDB store in place**. Headline: an **experimental, opt-in Agent-to-Agent (A2A)
task server**, plus scanner/query hot-path perf wins and release-pipeline hardening.

### Added

- **Experimental A2A server** — `basemind a2a serve`, gated behind `--features a2a` and intentionally
  excluded from the default and `full` builds and from the shipped release binary. One axum listener
  serves the A2A task protocol three ways — gRPC `A2AService`, JSON-RPC 2.0, and SSE streaming — with
  the agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. Hardened surfaces: **bearer-token auth** (constant-
  time compare, non-loopback bind refused without a token), **TLS termination** (`--tls-cert` /
  `--tls-key`, ALPN h2 + http/1.1), and **push-notification webhook delivery** behind a real **SSRF
  guard** (rejects loopback, RFC-1918, link-local, and the cloud-metadata IP; re-checks the resolved
  address and pins it on connect).
- **`rescan` levers** (CLI + MCP) plus robust auto-rescan on an empty working-view index.
- **comms `inbox_ack`** — advances the per-agent read cursor (idempotent, non-destructive; the shared
  append-only room log is untouched) — and **richer message front-matter** (`ts_micros`, `tags`,
  `reply_to`, `seq`, and an optional `scope` path/glob set for relevance filtering).

### Changed

- **Scanner/query perf** — cache the parse-timeout env lookup, pre-classify L1 captures, and defer the
  walk allocation in the scanner inner loop; serve `outline` from the in-RAM cache to cut query-path
  allocations; bounded-concurrent crawl indexing aligned with the kreuzberg parallelism pool.

### Fixed

- **Atomic release publishing + resilient wrappers** — a version-consistency gate across all shipped
  surfaces, an unconditional checksums job asserting every archive, `needs`/`result == success` guards
  on each publish job, and fail-closed retrying npm/pip installers with an atomic cache. Fixes the
  v0.5.0 broken-install regression (missing checksums file → every wrapper install failed).
- **comms daemon** reconnects and respawns on a broken pipe instead of failing the request.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-20

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 4 → 5, so the blob, Fjall-index, and LanceDB schema versions
advance — the first `basemind scan` / `serve` after upgrading **wipes and rebuilds the `.basemind/`
cache and the LanceDB store in place**. Headline: basemind becomes a multi-agent **communication
substrate** (scoped rooms + per-agent inbox) on top of its context layer, with split memory and
cross-harness delivery.

### Added

- **Agent-to-agent communication.** A singleton, user-global **broker daemon** (its own Fjall
  store over a Unix socket, independent of any repo's exclusive index lock) hosts **scope-joined
  rooms** — an agent auto-joins every room covering its git remote, a path prefix, or global.
  Messages are **two-tier**: a front-matter envelope (subject · from · id) that `room_history` /
  `inbox_read` scan cheaply, plus a body fetched on demand by `message_get`. An agent's **own**
  posts are excluded from its inbox. New MCP tools `agent_register`, `agent_list`, `room_create`,
  `room_list`, `room_join`, `room_leave`, `room_post`, `room_history`, `message_get`, `inbox_read`,
  with full `basemind comms …` CLI parity.
- **Split memory.** Memory gains an **individual** (per-agent) tier alongside the existing
  **group** (shared) tier, selected by a `visibility` parameter; agent identity resolves from
  `BASEMIND_AGENT_ID` → config → persisted `.basemind/agent-id` → `anon`.
- **Cross-harness delivery.** The comms mandate and a "prefer basemind over grep/git/manual"
  directive ship to every harness via the MCP server `instructions`, a new **`basemind-comms`
  skill**, and the generated per-harness instruction files. **SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit
  hooks** inject unread front-matter on boot and per turn; a **background monitor (~15 s)** surfaces
  new messages while an agent works or idles (Claude Code).
- **Statusline comms segment.** The basemind statusline now shows the agent's unread message count
  (bright when non-zero) and identity, gated on a running broker and TTL-cached so it stays cheap.

### Changed

- **Schema bump: `RELEASE_MINOR` 4 → 5.** The blob, Fjall-index, and LanceDB `memory`/`documents`
  schema versions advance, so the first `basemind scan` / `serve` after upgrading **wipes and
  rebuilds the `.basemind/` cache and the LanceDB store in place** (the latter now guarded by a
  `memory_schema_ver` in `meta.json` so the memory-table column add never faults at query time).
  Stored memory is rebuildable scratch, not a source of truth — re-`memory_put` anything you want
  to keep, or expect it to be re-derived.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-19

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 3 → 4, so the blob + index schema versions advance.
The first `basemind scan` / `serve` after upgrading rebuilds the cache in place. Prebuilt binaries
now ship `--features full` (96 document formats, OCR, embeddings, reranker, semantic search, web
crawl, shared memory). **Windows asset triple changed:** `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` → `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
(ONNX Runtime ships no MinGW prebuilts); anyone hard-coding the old asset name must update.
**Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) is no longer shipped** — macOS prebuilts are Apple Silicon
(`aarch64-apple-darwin`) only; Intel Mac users build from source (`cargo install basemind --features full`).

### Added

- **Full-feature prebuilt binaries via native per-platform runner.** All prebuilt binaries
  (Homebrew, npm, pip, GitHub Releases) now ship `--features full`: 96 document formats (PDF,
  Office, email, HTML, archives, structured, source, markup), OCR (Tesseract), HEIC/AVIF
  (libheif), embeddings + reranker + NER, shared memory, and web crawl. First use downloads ML
  models over the network; binaries are larger. Replaced goreleaser with a new native
  per-platform CI runner pipeline.
- **Enforced binary checksum verification.** All install paths (npm, pip/uvx, direct download via
  `mcp-launch.sh`) now verify the binary's sha256 against `basemind_<version>_checksums.txt` and
  fail closed on mismatch or missing checksum. (This was previously claimed in the README but not
  implemented.)

### Changed

- **`find_references` and `find_implementations` now do real substring matching.** Previously
  documented as substring matching but actually exact-only. Now genuinely substring (case-sensitive),
  so `Foo::bar()` and `bar()` both match `name="bar"`.
- **Dropped Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) prebuilt binaries.** macOS releases are Apple Silicon
  only. npm/pip/Homebrew install on an Intel Mac now fails fast with a clear message; build from source
  instead.

### Fixed

- **SSRF denylist + redirect revalidation for web crawler.** Added safeguards to prevent server-side
  request forgery on the `web_scrape` and `web_crawl` tools.
- **Configured embedder preset.** Eliminates cross-process vector state wipe, improving performance
  and cache isolation.
- **Atomic memory writes.** Prevents torn writes on concurrent `memory_put` across sessions.
- **Index panic on corrupted entries.** Fixed a panic when the Fjall index contained malformed keys
  (now degrades gracefully).
- **Git blame robustness.** Improved handling of edge cases (missing commits, detached HEAD, shallow
  repos).
- **Config layer precedence fixes.** MCP > CLI > env > TOML > defaults now strictly enforced.
- **Hot-path allocation cuts.** Reduced allocations in scanner, extract, and query paths; removed
  unnecessary `String::from_utf8` round-trips and clones in the Fjall secondary-index scans.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-18

Minor release: `RELEASE_MINOR` bumps 2 → 3, so the blob + index schema versions advance.
Unlike previous minor bumps, the cache is **no longer hard-wiped** — see "Durable cache
refresh" below. The first `basemind scan` / `serve` after upgrading re-extracts in place.

### Added

- **Full MCP↔CLI parity.** Every MCP tool now has a `basemind` CLI subcommand, running the
  identical in-process tool code against the same on-disk index (read-only, no lock — safe
  to run alongside a live `basemind serve`). Human-readable output by default, `--json` for
  the raw structured response. New groups: `basemind query` (outline, symbol, search,
  references, callers, implementations, call-graph, grep, list-files, status, repo-info,
  dependents), `basemind git` (status, history, blame, diffs, churn, symbol-history),
  `basemind memory`, `basemind web`, and `basemind telemetry`.
- **Cache garbage collection + cleanup.** New `cache_gc` (reclaim orphaned blobs no view
  references), `cache_stats` (on-disk size + orphan accounting), and `cache_clear` MCP
  tools, plus `basemind cache gc|stats|clear` CLI commands. GC runs automatically in the
  background on `serve` startup. Blobs are shared across views; GC only sweeps blobs no
  view's index references, under the store lock so it never races a scan.
- **Continuous background watch.** `basemind serve` now watches the working tree and
  incrementally refreshes its index in the background by default (debounced), keeping
  queries fresh without manual `rescan`. Opt out with `basemind serve --no-watch` for very
  large repos / CI.
- **`basemind-cli` skill** documenting the CLI surface, and a restructured README with two
  equal install paths (MCP plugin vs CLI + skill).

### Changed

- **Durable cache refresh on schema bump.** A schema/version bump now refreshes the
  content-addressed blob store **in place** (re-extract overwrites blobs at their stable
  content-hash path; background GC reclaims the remainder) instead of deleting
  `.basemind/blobs/`. No window where the expensive extraction cache is gone. The Fjall
  secondary index (derived, cheap) still rebuilds from blobs on its own schema bump.
- **Git-cache schema** is now tied to `RELEASE_MINOR` so a release refreshes it consistently
  (it auto-rebuilds from git).

### Fixed

- **Tightened token-savings estimate.** The `telemetry_summary` "tokens saved" figure no
  longer scales with total corpus size (it previously credited ~5% of the whole repo per
  grep-style call). Baselines are now derived from the actual response payload, decoupled
  from corpus size.
- **Read-only store degrades gracefully on a schema bump.** A CLI query run before the first
  post-upgrade scan now reads an empty index ("run `basemind scan`") instead of erroring,
  and never opens the stale Fjall index.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Responsive two-line statusline with per-capability metrics.** The status line now
  renders a context row (model · output-style · vim · dir · branch · context%) above the
  basemind row, since a custom statusLine replaces Claude Code's default and cannot sit
  below it. The basemind row breaks telemetry down per capability — searches, git, docs,
  memory, web — showing only buckets with activity today, alongside calls and estimated
  tokens saved. Width comes from `$COLUMNS` with full/compact/minimal tiers; override with
  `BASEMIND_STATUSLINE` and hide the context row with `BASEMIND_STATUSLINE_CONTEXT=0`.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **PreToolUse guard hook drives basemind usage.** A configurable hook
  (`hooks/pre-tool-guard`) reaches the agent when it reaches for `Grep`/`Glob` and
  points it at the matching basemind tool — the only Claude Code lever that can also
  cover subagents. `BASEMIND_GUARD` selects the mode: `nudge` (default, advisory once
  per session), `redirect` (deny with a pointer to the basemind tool), or `off`.
- **Full-capability awareness in the agent surfaces.** The always-injected MCP
  `get_info` instructions and the `basemind` skill now describe the whole surface —
  code map across 300+ languages, full-text + semantic search, git intelligence,
  document RAG over 90+ file formats, shared memory, and web crawl — instead of a
  code-map-only framing. The README leads with the same capability set.

### Fixed

- **`Store::open` no longer races on a just-released lock.** `acquire_lock` retries the
  exclusive `flock` with a short backoff, fixing a macOS-only flake where a sequential
  open → close → open hit `Locked`.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Context-economy operating discipline shipped across every agent surface.** The
  MCP `get_info` instructions, the `basemind` skill, the SessionStart hook, and the
  README now state one default workflow: these tools return paths, line numbers, and
  signatures rather than file bodies, so agents `outline` before reading,
  `search_symbols` / `find_references` / `workspace_grep` before grep, and `rescan`
  after edits. The SessionStart hook injects this every session instead of only
  nudging when the statusline is unset.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **`serve` auto-scans a fresh repo on startup.** When the working-view index is
  empty, the server kicks off an initial scan in the background (reusing the
  in-process `rescan` path, so it never contends for the Fjall lock). The agent
  no longer has to run `basemind scan` by hand — the statusline flips from
  "scanning…" to live counts on its own.
- **`.basemind/` is now self-ignoring.** The first time the store is created it
  writes `.basemind/.gitignore` containing `*`, so a user's repository never
  accidentally commits the machine-local index. An existing `.gitignore` is left
  untouched.

### Changed

- **README redesign.** Centered hero with a uniform badge row, a fenced
  statusline preview (replacing a broken image reference), and collapsible
  architecture / harness-setup sections. Clarified that registering the
  marketplace and installing the plugin are two distinct steps.

### Fixed

- **Nightly hardening CI is green again.** The `hardening` job built
  `--features full` (kreuzberg's libheif + tesseract stack) but only installed
  protoc, so the `libheif-sys` build failed. The job now installs the codec dev
  libraries and builds libheif 1.23.0 from source (cached across runs).

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin now auto-installs the basemind binary.** The MCP launcher
  (`scripts/mcp-launch.sh`) tries version-matched cached binaries, then npx
  (npm package), uvx (PyPI package), and finally downloads the prebuilt binary
  from the GitHub release with checksum verification. Override the launch strategy
  with `BASEMIND_LAUNCHER=auto|npx|uvx|download`.
- **SessionStart hook pre-warms the binary and nudges statusline setup.** The
  hook runs in the background on session start to ensure the first tool call isn't
  a cold install, and suggests `/bm-statusline` if the statusline isn't yet
  configured.
- **`/bm-statusline` slash command wires the statusline into
  `~/.claude/settings.json`.** Plugins cannot set the main statusline
  automatically; `/bm-statusline` is the one-step opt-in.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Claude Code slash commands now load.** The `/bm` and `/bm-stats` commands
  were under `.claude-plugin/commands/`, which Claude Code ignores — plugin
  component directories must sit at the plugin root, and basemind's marketplace
  `source` is `"./"`, so the plugin root is the repo root. Moved `commands/`
  (and confirmed `skills/`) to the repo root; `.claude-plugin/` now holds only
  the manifests + statusline. The Codex / Cursor / OpenCode trees keep their own
  in-tree copies (their plugin root is their own directory), kept in sync by
  `scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh`.

### Changed

- **Publish workflow no longer hard-fails on a missing Homebrew token.** The
  GitHub-release-assets job skips the Homebrew tap publisher when
  `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` is absent (and runs it when present), so an optional tap
  update can't fail the binary release.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

**Minor release — schema wipe (`RELEASE_MINOR=2`).** The blob and inverted-index
formats are versioned to the release minor, so the next `basemind scan` rebuilds
`.basemind/` from source. This is the intentional migration path; no user action
beyond a rescan is needed.

### Changed

- **Dependencies on crates.io.** `kreuzberg` moved from the `v5.0.0-rc.15` git pin
  to the published crates.io release `=5.0.0-rc.18`; the temporary `allow-git`
  exemptions in `deny.toml` are dropped. With no remaining git dependencies,
  `cargo publish` to crates.io is unblocked — basemind now ships on all four
  registries (crates.io, npm, PyPI, Homebrew) from a single tag.
- **README is now a positioning document.** Rewritten from a code-map feature
  inventory into a full AI-context-layer overview: four pillars (Code, Documents,
  Memory, Web), a feature table mapping every MCP tool to its backend, a
  three-flavour quickstart, comparisons against grep / vector-only RAG /
  repo-map indexers / GitHub search, and a differentiators section. Sub-package
  READMEs (npm / PyPI / OpenCode) collapse to install stubs linking the root.
- **Aligned package metadata across all surfaces.** One canonical description and
  a positioning-led 5-keyword set (`mcp`, `agent-context`, `rag`, `code-map`,
  `tree-sitter`) now ship identically across `Cargo.toml`, the npm / PyPI
  manifests, and every harness plugin manifest. GitHub repo description + topics
  updated to match.

### Added

- **Redesigned Claude Code statusline.** Bright 256-color palette (no more
  low-contrast dim text), a `◆` brand mark, a dedicated serve/scan freshness
  dot, and width-aware wide/narrow layouts. The file count now reads the L1 blob
  set directly (exact, deduped) instead of estimating from index bytes; scan
  recency reads the view index mtime; an empty repo renders an actionable
  `run: basemind scan` hint instead of a blank line. The intelligence row
  (documents / memory / web) appears when a LanceDB store is present.
- **Agent-facing skills + slash commands bundled into every plugin tree.** The
  `basemind` routing skill and `basemind-stats` dashboard, plus `/bm` and
  `/bm-stats` slash commands, now ship inside `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`,
  `.cursor-plugin/`, and the `basemind-opencode` npm tarball — so an installed
  plugin teaches the agent how to use the tools without manual onboarding. A new
  `scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh` (wired as a poly hook) keeps the canonical
  source and the per-harness copies in lock-step.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **`npm-package`** — `npx basemind …` (and equivalent `npm install -g basemind`
  invocations) used to silently fall through to whatever `basemind` already lived
  on `$PATH` because npm skipped creating the `node_modules/.bin/basemind`
  symlink when the `bin:` target was missing at install time (the native binary
  is downloaded by `postinstall`). The wrapper now ships a Node.js shim at
  `bin/basemind.js` that `spawnSync`'s the downloaded native binary, so the
  symlink target exists at install time and npx routes correctly through the
  wrapper.
- **`publish.yaml`** — re-enabled the Homebrew tap step now that
  `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` is on the path to being provisioned. Set the secret on the
  basemind repo before pushing the next tag; goreleaser will then auto-update
  `Goldziher/homebrew-tap`'s `Formula/basemind.rb`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-15

**Initial public release.** First minor wipes the schema (`RELEASE_MINOR=1`)
so any pre-tag `.basemind/` cache rebuilds on next scan — intentional.

Feature-complete code-map server with the kreuzberg document tier surface
(reranker, keywords, NER, summarization, language detection, TOON output) and
schema-driven config across TOML / CLI / MCP / env vars, distributed across
all major coding-agent harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Factory
Droid, OpenCode, Copilot CLI, and the generic MCP path) plus npm / PyPI /
crates.io.

### Added

- **`basemind scan`** — rayon-parallel scanner that indexes a workspace into
  content-addressed msgpack blobs (`.basemind/blobs/`) plus a Fjall-backed
  inverted index (`.basemind/views/<view>/index.fjall/`). Two extraction tiers
  ship: L1 outlines (symbols, signatures, imports, docs) and L2 call sites;
  L3 structural hash available for symbol-history diffing.
- **`basemind serve`** — stdio MCP server (`rmcp`) exposing the full code-map
  and git-history tool surface (`outline`, `search_symbols`, `find_references`,
  `find_callers`, `list_files`, `dependents`, `repo_info`, `status`,
  `symbol_history`, `working_tree_status`, `recent_changes`,
  `commits_touching`, `find_commits_by_path`, `diff_file`, `diff_outline`,
  `hot_files`, `blame_file`, `blame_symbol`).
- **Dynamic 300+ language coverage** via
  [tree-sitter-language-pack](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/tree-sitter-language-pack).
  Hand-written `.scm` overrides ship for Rust, Python, TypeScript, TSX,
  JavaScript, Go. Other languages for which TSLP ships a vendored `tags.scm`
  (kotlin, csharp, swift, cpp, scala, solidity, lua, …) get best-effort
  symbol + call extraction via the fallback adapter that rewrites
  GitHub-standard `@definition.*` / `@reference.call` captures into
  basemind's `@symbol.*` / `@call.*` shape.
- **Schema-driven config across TOML / CLI / MCP / env vars.** Rust types in
  `src/config/` derive `schemars::JsonSchema`; the snapshot at
  `schema/basemind-config-v1.schema.json` is regenerated from those types and
  asserted by `tests/config_schema.rs`. Adding a config field lights up all
  four surfaces via `#[command(flatten)]` (clap) and `#[serde(flatten)]` (MCP
  params). Precedence: MCP > CLI > env > TOML > defaults, with per-field
  provenance tracking via `src/config/source.rs`.
- **Document tier** — `search_documents` MCP tool over Lance-backed embedding
  index with kreuzberg ingestion. Per-query overrides on every `documents.*`
  and `llm.*` setting, plus `entity_category` and `keywords_contains`
  post-filters.
- **TOON wire format** for MCP responses via
  `documents.output.format = "toon"` (or `--documents-output-format toon`).
  Round-trip parity with JSON asserted in `tests/mcp_smoke.rs`.
- **Language-aware ingestion.** `documents.language.{auto_detect,
  min_confidence, detect_multiple}` flows into kreuzberg's
  `LanguageDetectionConfig` and the chunking tokenizer. ISO 639-3 codes (e.g.
  `"fra"`) surface on `FileMapDoc.detected_languages`.
- **Cross-encoder reranker** as a post-step on `search_documents`. Off by
  default; `documents.reranker.{enabled,preset,top_k}` opts in. Preset is
  validated upfront against `kreuzberg::get_reranker_preset`; reranked index
  is bounds-checked before reorder.
- **Keyword extraction (YAKE / RAKE) and named entity recognition** at
  extract time. New tail fields on `FileMapDoc` (`keywords`, `entities`)
  with `#[serde(default)]` — blob-compatible with prior blob shapes
  (asserted by `tests/schema_bump.rs`).
- **Extractive + abstractive summarization** via `documents.summarization`.
  Abstractive routes through liter-llm with the new top-level `[llm]`
  section (model in `provider/model` form, api_key, base_url, temperature,
  timeout, retries, max_tokens). NER backend `llm` now wires the resolved
  `LlmConfig`.
- **`SecretString` newtype + `ApiKey` enum** (`Literal | Env | Unset`).
  Secrets mask to `"<redacted>"` in `Debug` / `Display` and across
  `Serialize` (including the toml→serde_json validation round-trip).
- **Real-OSS hardening harness** (`tests/harden.rs`, `./scripts/harden.sh`)
  — clones 8 upstream repos (ripgrep, tokio, typescript, react, django,
  requests, gin, ripgrep-shallow), exercises every MCP tool against each,
  and pins canary lower bounds (tokio: `find_references("spawn") >= 200`,
  django: `find_references("get") >= 200`,
  react: `search_symbols("useState") >= 20`,
  ripgrep-shallow truncation surfaces).
- **Schema sync to release version** — `RELEASE_MINOR` in `src/version.rs`
  drives both `INDEX_SCHEMA_VER` and the blob `SCHEMA_VER`. Minor-release
  bumps wipe `.basemind/` on next scan; patch releases stay compatible.
- Distribution: `brew install Goldziher/tap/basemind`,
  `npm install -g basemind`, `pip install basemind`,
  `cargo install basemind --locked`. Precompiled binaries on GitHub
  Releases for `{x86_64,aarch64}-{linux-gnu,apple-darwin}` and
  `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.
- **Per-harness install matrix** — manifests + skill bundle for every major
  coding-agent harness, all bumped in lock-step by
  `task release:sync-version VERSION=…`:
  - **Claude Code** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` +
    `statusline.sh` (live one-line summary of the indexed map with true-color
    brand mark, freshness dot, and call/token-savings telemetry from
    `.basemind/telemetry.jsonl`). Install via
    `/plugin marketplace add Goldziher/basemind` then
    `/plugin install basemind@basemind`.
  - **Codex CLI / App** — `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with full `interface`
    block (`displayName`, category `Developer Tools`, `capabilities`,
    `defaultPrompt`, `brandColor`). `scripts/sync-to-codex-plugin.sh` mirrors
    into a fork of the `openai/plugins` marketplace.
  - **Gemini CLI** — root-level `gemini-extension.json` with `contextFileName`
    and `mcpServers`. Install via
    `gemini extensions install https://github.com/Goldziher/basemind`.
  - **Cursor** — `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`.
  - **OpenCode** — published as the
    [`basemind-opencode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basemind-opencode)
    npm package. Install via
    `{ "plugin": ["basemind-opencode@latest"] }` in `opencode.json`. Skills
    are bundled into the tarball; the plugin shim does dual-mode resolution
    (bundled-path-first, repo-root-fallback) so monorepo dev and npm install
    both work without duplication.
  - **Factory Droid / GitHub Copilot CLI** — reuse the existing
    `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` per their published patterns.
  - Every manifest carries the same canonical user-facing description and
    crates.io-capped 5-keyword set (`mcp`, `tree-sitter`, `code-map`,
    `scanner`, `indexer`).
- **Release pipeline** — `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` publishes on
  every `v*` tag: GitHub release assets (cross-compiled binaries via
  goreleaser + zig), crates.io, npm × 2 (`basemind` binary wrapper +
  `basemind-opencode` OpenCode plugin), and PyPI. Per-registry idempotent
  via existing-version detection; OIDC-driven trusted publishers on all
  four registries.

### Changed

- `tree-sitter-language-pack`: `=1.9.0-rc.27` → `=1.9.0-rc.45`. Hierarchical
  `data_extraction` + 17 data formats; rc.40–45 are CI/codegen-only.
- `kreuzberg` bumped to the reranker / LLM API surface
  (`=5.0.0-rc.7` baseline → published rc covering reranker + LLM at publish
  time).
- `alloc-stdlib = "=0.2.2"` pin lifted (no longer binding after lock
  re-resolve; single `alloc-no-stdlib 2.0.4` in the tree).
- `src/mcp/types.rs` + `src/mcp/helpers.rs` split into `_documents.rs`
  siblings to stay under the 1000-line cap.

### Performance

- Harden 8/8 green across ripgrep / tokio / typescript / react / django /
  requests / gin / ripgrep-shallow. All canaries pass. Per-repo scan times
  within baseline: typescript 21.7 s (81 324 files), tokio 0.2 s (859
  files), django 2.5 s (7 061 files), react 2.2 s, requests 0.7 s, gin
  1.0 s, ripgrep 4.0 s, ripgrep-shallow 0.16 s. All 25 MCP tools clean
  across all repos.
- `search_documents` post-processing releases the store read-lock before
  blob I/O; `ahash::AHashMap` / `AHashSet` on the post-filter path.
