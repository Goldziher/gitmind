# bm-stats — basemind dashboard

Show a basemind dashboard with two sections: resource footprint (on-disk size + process RAM) and
activity (tool calls, per-tool histogram, estimated tokens saved).

## When to use

The user asks "how much is basemind helping?", "show me basemind stats", or wants to check disk /
RAM usage.

## How to use

Invoke `/bm-stats` (default window `today`) or `/bm-stats <today|1h|24h|all>`. Window: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Resource footprint.** MCP `admin { mode: "cache_stats" }`, or CLI `basemind admin cache-stats` (add `--json` to
   parse). Report: `total_bytes` (matches `du`), the per-component breakdown (blobs / views /
   git-history / lance / git-cache / telemetry / other), and process RAM (`rss_bytes` +
   `peak_rss_bytes`). If `blob_accounting_ok` is `false`, note that orphan accounting was skipped
   (stale/unreadable index — re-scan to restore it); the sizes are still accurate.

2. **Activity.** MCP `admin { mode: "telemetry", window: "…" }`, or CLI
   `basemind admin telemetry --window <today|1h|24h|all>`
   (add `--json`). Report call count, the per-tool histogram, and estimated tokens saved for the
   window.

3. **Render** both sections as a compact markdown dashboard.

## Notes

- Prefer MCP when connected, but don't depend on it — the CLI reads the same data with no server.
  If an `admin` mode isn't available, run its CLI equivalent instead of giving up.
- If neither MCP nor CLI is reachable, say so plainly and point at `/bm-doctor`.
- Always end with a one-sentence disclosure that the savings number is heuristic: tools without a
  realistic baseline (memory, document search, git wrappers) report 0 saved.
