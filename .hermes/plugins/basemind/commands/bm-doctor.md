# bm-doctor — diagnose and recover basemind

Diagnose and recover basemind using the CLI (works even with no MCP server running).

## When to use

basemind isn't behaving: MCP tools are missing or erroring, the statusline or a tool reports
"no index" / "no indexed files", results are empty when they shouldn't be, or the `basemind
serve` MCP server seems dead.

## How to use

Invoke `/bm-doctor` (optional free-text detail, e.g. `/bm-doctor tools return no indexed files`).
It runs the checks below in order:

1. Check the index: `basemind admin status`.
2. Check for a lock-holding server: `cat .basemind/.lock.meta`.
3. Rebuild the index if needed: `basemind scan`.
4. Reconnect the MCP server (client-specific — this is the only way to restart it).

## Notes

- A stdio MCP server can't be restarted by an agent or by basemind itself; reconnecting it is
  the MCP client's job. The CLI stays usable throughout.
